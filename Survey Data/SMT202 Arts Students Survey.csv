So even if there are more opportunities now for local artists, most are unable to sustain them simply because there isn't enough demand out there. Of course this is a problem that requires long-term solutions, but giving artists more platforms to reach out to a wider, more diverse audience is definitely the way to go in the short run, especially targeting the youths cos the current generation of students right now are going to be become future parents right). So yes, more accessible platforms to showcase local artist(e)s, and it'd be even better if you could also shine a spotlight on genres that are less seen, and give them a platform to explain why they do what they do.

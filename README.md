# SMT202-G1T5
This [SMU-X](https://x.smu.edu.sg/about/what-is-smu-x) project is done by [Lau Jun Rong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laujunrong/), [Ryan Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-tan-bb7037180/), [Christine Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisjttan/), [James Lim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-lim-jy/) & Aaron Lee for our SMT202 (Analytics Applications for Smart Living Project) module.

The team presented on our proposed solution which is modelled after a sharing economy model that aims to increase engagement in the local arts scene through using spare capacity in SMU Connexion. Our solution is supported by multiple analysis such as geospatial analysis of SMU and its competitors, social listening and analysis of our stakeholders, classification techniques like logistic regression, virtualization of the prototype and social science concepts to evaluate our solution and its alignment to current policies.

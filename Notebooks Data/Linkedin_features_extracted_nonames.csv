Software Development & Networking,Singapore,"I'm a software developer engineer, ""the wifi guy"", and a teacher of the art of writing 'Hello World's.  More? Alright, since you asked!  I started writing websites in PHP in 2008, and now write in Python, Ruby on Rails and JavaScript (React). I learnt Java through academia and obtained the top score at the University of London's Object-Oriented Programming examination in 2015. To that end, I got Proxor-2 certified in 2017.  While I see the benefits of object-oriented programming, I've also implemented simple python scripting for an automation framework for data pipelines in AWS to perform ETL workloads and data quality checks of processed Tableau data. This makes such checks and pipelines accessible to all levels of engineers, including analysts who may not have programming backgrounds.  Some might say that strongly-typed languages slow development speed, but I find that it helps in long-term maintainability and in development teams, which led me to use TypeScript while working in Visa and in all my subsequent JS work. Coupled with strong CI/CD workflows, this has brought about a higher level of confidence in the code that we produced at Hackwagon Academy, where I wrote a full-stack, multi-tenant HR/payroll platform to support the operations team's unique processes.  Other than writing code, maintaining network equipment takes up most of my time. It gives my slight OCD a good kick when WiFi deployments are appropriately sized and secured. Other than that, I also enjoy helping my friends out with their programming questions, which is why I used to spend weekends in Singapore at Hackwagon.com teaching Python and Full-stack Web Development. Otherwise, I'm on StackOverflow reviewing queues or on GitHub submitting PRs. I've also recently gotten my 4th professional certification, as an AWS Cloud Practitioner.

Sophomore in Singapore Management University,Singapore,"I believe in diversity, stability and innovation.   It is important to me to skill myself in a diverse range of expertise. I believe that having a diversified set of skills is not only essential to the current workplace, but it also provides me with stability.  In this volatile day and age, it is important for me to find stability in the work I do and the life I live to achieve peace. Witnessing first-hand the horrors a single recession can do to a man's pride and even his will to live, I vowed to myself to never have to let myself, or anyone I hold close to me go through such an ordeal again.   While diversity and stability brings me peace, innovation brings me joy. Innovation allows me to think creatively, and execute ideas that can be absolutely ridiculous, yet engaging and fun! Innovation is also the criteria that is required for companies to get ahead of each other and boost their competitiveness.

Management Consultant (Senior Associate) at PwC South East Asia Consulting,Singapore,"- My current work - As a Management Consultant at PwC, I start every day excited at the prospect of taking on a new challenge, learning something new and expanding my network.   - Education - Before I started work, I graduated with a Bachelor in Business Management (Summa Cum Laude) from Singapore Management University. My university experience transcended mere academic knowledge by providing me a global perspective, ingraining a duty to serve the community and honing essential soft-skills. As a result, I entered the workforce with confidence, humility and enthusiasm.   - Personal life - Apart from work, I make it a point to lead a balanced life by engaging in a variety of activities. First, to attain a skill not directly relevant to my job, I am learning HTML to introduce myself to coding! Second, to satiate my curiousity, I am pursuing an entrepreneurial venture as a side-project in Travel-tech industry. Third, to remain physically active, I enjoy Sunday football games and am beginning to learn golf. Other than this, I enjoy reading murder mystery novels, writing reflective literature pieces, binge-searching places to travel, and even taking an evening off to enjoy a round of Texas Hold 'Em with friends.   - In summary - I seek opportunities that allow me to re-imagine possibilities, challenge norms and create value.

I still have a long way to go, but I learned a few things, from becoming more independent and hardworking to being less selfish; just to name a few.  I also took on leadership roles and internships to improve myself. From there, I met a lot of wonderful people, got exposed to real world problems, and realised my passion in people, finance and marketing.   Yes, I started to become obsessed in helping other people. It brings such a genuine joy in the art of giving, for both the giver and the recipient; especially when you’ve experienced how bad you needed those helps back in the days. This also applies to work. What customers want nowadays is not only a great outcome, but also a great process. If we start to be sincere in what we do in helping them to achieve their goals, we would not only be successful, but also personally accomplished.   When I feel like taking a break from the hectic university and job-hunting routine, I will be reading books, watching comedy shows, movies and sport clips. And yes, I love sport, so much. Sport teaches me a lot of amazing lessons, from perseverance, problem solving, and not to mention it increases both your mental and physical health.   At the core, I am a student, and I always will be. I will never stop learning from people and circumstances while hoping to make the best out of it at the same time.  I know I might be knocked down again someday along the line, but I hope I will get back up every time it happens.  Anyway, maybe it’s true when people say “you need to get lost in order to be found”.  No matter how cliche that might sound, I feel that’s the best way to summarise my whole journey so far.

Marketing Science & Analytics Intern at PHD Media | Business & Data Analyst | Master of IT in Business Analytics at SMU,Singapore,"I have a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industry. Skilled in consulting, production support, and service with applied knowledge.  Having worked with data, my interests have revolved around Operations Management, Business Strategy/Solutions and Organization Structure. I started looking at how businesses have realized the importance of utilizing big data analytics to maximize their profits, where actionable insights are derived from data related to both the organization as well as the industry. Data analytics is also required in order to maintain sustained growth of the business operations and to compete in the market in an era where the customers are flooded with ever-increasing choices. The major aspects of concern for any business is the speed and accuracy of making a business decision, and data analytics covers these concerns with ease as its principal of operation is based on the statistical modelling of data and usage of analytical tools to convert raw data into useful information. Through the same, I have come to appreciate business analytics as the backbone of success for any business and moving forth, I envision myself within the same sphere of decision makers who determine the tide of businesses across the globe.  Currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Analytics at SMU, I am open to opportunities that enable me to make use of data for innovation, optimization and solving real, large scale issues in the analytics field which in turn facilitates game changing business decisions.

Student at Singapore Management University,Singapore,"""We are changing the world with technology."" - Bill Gates  I have a keen interest in technology and strongly believe that good utilisation of technology has the ability to bring delights to the user.  I love creating applications; be it website or mobile. It is the most direct and expressive ways to delight your users with technology as they get to interact with it visually and physically. Yet, I do not limit myself to just the front-end glitz as I understand a good front-end application will never be possible without a strong back-end supporting it. As such, I worked with back-end frameworks to increase my knowledge in this aspect.  I also believe in lifelong learning. Keeping myself updated with the latest technology frameworks and stacks allows me to create more exciting and delightful applications for my users. Better programming practises and newer programming paradigm allows for a better application!  When I am not coding, I play computer games or go for a run or swim.

Penultimate Student at Singapore Management University,Singapore,"Hey there, I am currently a Penultimate year student at Singapore Management University (SMU) and I am pursuing a degree in Accountancy with a Second Major in Finance. The past 3 years in SMU has nurtured and cultivated my passion for accountancy. I have always enjoyed working with numbers and pursuing this degree just has enhanced my love for this profession. Unraveling the realms of knowledge in this profession is something I look forward to everyday when I attend the respective modules in SMU. I have been in the Dean’s List for AY 16/17 and AY 17/18 and this further exemplifies my abilities in this profession.   I always believe improving myself and doing things outside of just studies. Alongside studies, I took on positions as the Chairman for the SMU Freshmen Orientation 2017 and the position of Honorary General Secretary for the SMU Student Association (SMUSA) 14th Council and 18th SMUSA Executive Committee. These experiences have helped me hone my leadership and people management skills. In my first year in SMU, I also decided to be part of an Overseas Community Service Project to Chiangmai, Thailand where we taught the Thai Kids English as well as built a toilet for them.  Above all, I enjoy making new friends as it definite helps to break the monotony in life. Furthermore, I enjoy travelling as I enjoy seeking out experiences and moments which will remain with me for life. I hope to complete travelling around the whole world in the next 20 years. I have thus far travelled to London, Scotland, Dubai, Nepal to name a few.  In my free time, I head to the gym to unwind after a long day in school.

Final Year Student at Singapore Management University,Singapore,"Final year information systems undergraduate expected to graduate in 2020.   Since young, I always had an interest in all things IT-related. Whenever I encounter an issue in the technological domain, I will always try to get to the root of the problem and make an effort to understand the cause of it. In my early days, you will find me tweaking Microsoft Window's configuration settings to figure out the full range of features the operating system have to offer us, or tinkering around with the router's configuration settings to improve the network bandwidth limit.  This initial curiosity was what spurred me to pursue a diploma in Network Systems & Security Systems, where I acquired a foundation in networking. During this stint, I am fortunate to be given the opportunity to assist the researchers of A*STAR in a department experimenting with the usage of wireless sensor micro-controller boards to form a real-time data-driven network made of out sensors, giving me my first experience in IOT.  Now, I am currently working towards a degree in Information Systems.

"Business Analyst - COO Office at Bank of Singapore, Asia's Global Private Bank",Singapore,"I have recently graduated from Singapore Management University with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Management, majoring in both Corporate Communications and Arts and Culture Management.   8 of my past 18 months were spent at the private bank Bank of Singapore, assuming 2 different internship positions with the COO Office and Marketing team respectively. While this meant a delayed graduation, I found the tradeoff for valuable experience and insight to the private banking world worthy. This extended amount of time with one institution  not only gave me deepened insight into how various functions interact and work together across teams, it provided significant learning opportunities through working on major events such as the Bank’s thought-leadership event “A Moderated Conversation with President Barack Obama”.  I am always pursuing new ways of growing and moving out of my comfort zone. For instance, I spent a summer in Italy as the Communications Manager for an art biennale, establishing connections with brilliant minds in the art world while writing press releases, liaising with magazines, managing social media accounts, and working on the biennale catalog. Later that year, I competed for a one-month long stint at The Travel Intern, which took me to 4 countries and exposed me to the previously unfamiliar world of travel writing and video creation. Besides learning how to generate SEO-optimised articles, I was challenged daily with sponsored activities like completing the world’s highest manmade bungee jump, all of which were documented on web video series The Travel Intern Life.  No matter how inconvenient, unlikely, or foreign, my willingness to learn and zealousness to grow both professionally and personally have taken me to and through many new experiences, cultures, and environments.

Final year student at SMU | Marketing and Psychology major,Singapore,"Curious, self-motivated and adaptable - there are three adjectives I would use to describe myself.   Marketing as a career came naturally to me as I always had a penchant for writing/ storytelling, an interest in psychology/ consumer behaviour and enjoy selling new things. I see the impact marketing has on businesses, especially in this age of technology, where it begins to intersect with data and business performance. And I desire to venture into the digital marketing or brand management space!   I have learnt to work in teams, to speak up and take initiative through my experiences in CCAs, organising committees or in teams.

Also, I believe in the importance of adaptability, especially in different and challenging environments, particularly in a team.

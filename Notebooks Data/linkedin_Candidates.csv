Skilled in consulting, production support, and service with applied knowledge.  Having worked with data, my interests have revolved around Operations Management, Business Strategy/Solutions and Organization Structure. I started looking at how businesses have realized the importance of utilizing big data analytics to maximize their profits, where actionable insights are derived from data related to both the organization as well as the industry. Data analytics is also required in order to maintain sustained growth of the business operations and to compete in the market in an era where the customers are flooded with ever-increasing choices. The major aspects of concern for any business is the speed and accuracy of making a business decision, and data analytics covers these concerns with ease as its principal of operation is based on the statistical modelling of data and usage of analytical tools to convert raw data into useful information. Through the same, I have come to appreciate business analytics as the backbone of success for any business and moving forth, I envision myself within the same sphere of decision makers who determine the tide of businesses across the globe.  Currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Analytics at SMU, I am open to opportunities that enable me to make use of data for innovation, optimization and solving real, large scale issues in the analytics field which in turn facilitates game changing business decisions.

In my role as a Sponsorship Executive for SMU Challenge 2018, I was conscious of my lack of experience and proactively built up my communication and relationship-building skills. With the help of a fastidious mentor, I was able to enrich my persuasion and crisis management skills whilst adding value to the charity event.   I believe that excellent attitudes should not be left to chance. As a leader of an Overseas Community Service Project (OCSP), I adopted an agile mindset. Embracing uncertainty, I was willing to unlearn everything I knew about leadership and took every everything as a learning opportunity. With the realisation that in learning, there is no failure, only feedback, I was able to push the OCSP to new heights and hone my critical thinking capability.  I believe that excellent experiences should not be left to chance. By striving to inject meaning into everything I do, I was able to transform my first corporate event planning intern role from an entry position to that of a mini executive. Tenacious and being able to thrive under pressure, I was a reliable worker trusted by both colleagues and clients.  Eager to leave a positive mark everywhere I go, I am always looking to tackle the next big challenge.

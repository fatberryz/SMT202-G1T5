It  more on teaching drawing than doing business. Give more freedom to students in thier art. Lessons is 2hours, student really can forcus on learning well better than only 45mins lesson.",2018-10-28 04:29:11

We engaged Heartroom Gallery for our divisional mass artjam session in early June for 100pax. Mei, Germaine and their team of facilitators were very friendly and helpful in assisting us with our set up when we were running late. For the number of participants, there's sufficient facilitators going around giving suggestions or guidance to people that need them. In particular, we were very happy that everyone is provided with their own set of canvas, brush, water and plastic plate (for paint). Everyone had fun and the event was a success.  Will definitely return to Heartroom Gallery for my own artsy time.",2017-06-20 03:11:35

We didnt expect the finished piece was so impressive!  Mei was very patient to guide us with some painting strokes and that made alot of difference on the painting.

We enjoyed artjamming very much.  Will come back again with our 2 young kids - ""Art jamming for family""",2017-04-05 08:02:47

Sincere thanks for MuzArt team from Singapore for visiting my center in Cambodia, a rural place filled with lovely children.

Your whole team really brought something inspiring and new to our students on our land. They learn how to freely express their feeling via art, the activities conducted by your team did make my kids enjoy learning very much, these kind of interacts they hardly found in local schools.

Finally I wish you all the very very best, hope that all my 220 students will have a chance to see you all again very soon! 

Regards

I love to explore different ways of painting and thank you MuzArt for giving me such a great platform to play around with. I have painted on canvas, egg cartons, totebags, played with fluid art and marbling art etc. I had such great fun, highly recommended for adults who want to release their inner child and have fun!",2020-02-21 01:10:31

I believe it is their learning experiences at MuzArt that left such a strong impression to them. As a parent, I am impressed how the teachers engaged my children with so much fun and at the same time, they learnt to express their ideas through a structured curriculum that impart proper art techniques to the children. 

To some of us, the fees might seems high at the 1st glance. However, it is definitely value for money! Suggestion ~ Check with any of their branches for ""1-time"" workshop and let your child experience it. 

p.s. My children enjoyed their workshops in Jurong East branch, which is the HQ.",2020-02-04 05:04:23

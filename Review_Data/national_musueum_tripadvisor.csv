Ляля Б,3,22-Feb,Feb-20,10,Very bad staff,"Very rude, principled staff at the box office, I arrived at 6 o’clock, the woman told me that the cash desk was closed at 6 o’clock and refused to sell me a ticket !!!"

31sherriw,75,20-Feb,Dec-19,50,What an amazing surprise!,You need a good day to discover this fascinating history of Singapore.  I learned so much about its short history.

Customz,105,18-Feb,Jun-19,50,Great experience...,"The National Museum of Singapore is a MUST, even for those that might find museums boring. This building is full of exhibits and history that one has to be immersed. It was indeed a great experience."
,,,,,,
Della G,692,16-Feb,Nov-19,50,National Museum of Singapore,"A beautiful museum experience.  National Museum of Singapore is housed in a formidable, elegant neo classical building with the establishment of the museum dating back to 1887.  The displays are extraordinary and well displayed.  It appeals to anyone who likes history and definitely gives visitors a detailed outline of this unique island country.  Interesting informative diorama visuals and hands on exhibits that are suitable for youngsters and accompanying family alike.  The second floor houses  different galleries that focus on special themes as fashion, food, progress within the island community,  photography etc.  Each area takes time to explore. The most impressive display was the Story of the Forest which is a fascinating digital experience.  It is a colorful, lively and fanciful digital display that leaves a pleasant memorable images in your mind.  The museum is not free and the admission is more than a nominal fee but it is truly a first rated museum in Singapore."

wil r,79,15-Feb,Jan-20,40,Building complex a historical treasure,Building is a must see.  Exhibits seemed disjointed / fragmented.   Try to sort though exhibits you really want to see before visit.
,,,,,,
Mal W,14,11-Feb,May-19,50,Not just a Museum,"Usually museums can be boring but not the National Museum in Singapore there is so much history plus special displays you can immerse yourself in, especially the living dome see it for yourself so hard to describe the experience"
,,,,,,
JDH,9,11-Feb,Feb-20,40,Very informative,"Great museum. New exhibit on the history of the spice trade and development of Singapore was very interesting, with loads of information"
,,,,,,
Ingeborg56,"1,953",10-Feb,Feb-20,50,Very impressive museum on many floors.,"The cashier was very good in informing us about the different ticket types, - we chose to combo ticket which covered the whole museum. The exhibitions are very well presented, - also included huge wall to wall film - and very interesting about the history of Singapore and also the emphasis on women's education etc. Learned a lot from this visit!"
,,,,,,
ddilling30,71,10-Feb,Feb-20,50,"Outstanding, world class museum!","Without doubt, this is a brilliant, world class museum and a MUST for all visitors.<br/>We took the combined ticket(reduced rate for Seniors) and spent 4 hours on the special exhibition and the History Gallery only.<br/>It id possible to return another day on the same ticket. Ask and you will be issued with a new sticker.<br/>The museum is housed in a beautifully maintained colonial style building and is very well laid out, so the story flows. Helpful interpretation panels are not too wordy. The language is accessible and the text the right length.<br/>The cafe has a nice selection of reasonably priced light meals, snacks and drinks.<br/>Altogether an excellent museum!"

paul_pru_skittles,404,9-Feb,Sep-19,40,good restaurants for meeting friends,often eat here when meeting friends/ex-colleagues who are visiting SG from malaysia. a range of selections to choose from with most priced in the mid-range

Jim_atl,"1,033",7-Feb,Feb-20,50,Take the Free Tour,"I was lucky to arrive a little before 11 am and was told that a one hour tour was about to start.  There were only a few of us on the tour.  The tour guide was very interesting and took us around the two important old building.  She showed us things I would likely not have seen and learned about the history of the buildings and and saw pictures of the way they used to look when they were the city hall and the supreme court.  I then spent time looking at some of the art, which was interesting to see art of Asia and understand the way things used to be.  To me that highlight was the tour and the two old buildings (and the way they were combined and updated to be a museum)."
,,,,,,
Leslie H,13,4-Feb,Jan-20,50,A must visit,"The whole experience of the musium was fantastic, the exhibitions and amount of things to see are truely amaising. We must also recomend that any one who visits the Museum to take advantage of the internal restaurant there. The friendy and most atentive staff will make your visit a pleasurable one. I can personaly recomend the home made Lemon Iced tea with wine, a delisiously refreshing drink. My wife nicknamed it alchoholic Ribeena because of the colour after you stired the wine into the Icedtea. I would go back there again just for another one."
,,,,,,
Koloblicin,268,4-Feb,Dec-19,50,Central location ,Join the free guided tour in national museum if you have time. A great place to know singapore's history in the beautiful architecture
,,,,,,
Fred T,729,3-Feb,Feb-20,30,"Best if you can join a free tour; otherwise, just OK","I lucked out and entered just before the free 2 PM tour was to start.  That tour hit the highlights of the museum in 1.5 hours (was supposed to be 1.0 hours).  After that tour, I did the rest of the exhibits.  I was expecting more, so was disappointed.  I paid $19."
,,,,,,
jglove44,4,Jan-20,Jan-20,40,Great exhibitions,"This museum is a treasure! Fantastic exhibitions showing the history of Singapore, from the early settlers, to Colonial Settlement, to Japanese occupation all the way to today. Got the ‘access all areas’ pass which allows you to see the limited edition exhibition as well as the permanent exhibitions - it was worth it. Ended up spending nearly 7 hours here, it is that good. Highly recommend it."
,,,,,,
Janja,146,Jan-20,Jan-20,50,Good choice on a rainy day,"The museum demonstrates the history and cultural identity of the country. I would recommend you to take the ticket with special exhibitions included ($26), as they have some amazing animated and interactive presentations."
,,,,,,
ksthompson,23,Jan-20,Jan-20,40,Good history lesson,"We got there for a free 1-hour tour in English in the early afternoon, and the guide was quite good."
,,,,,,
alpatdunc,113,Jan-20,Jan-20,40,Great exhibitions,"This is the place to go for all your early Singapore history.  I absolutely loved learning about the early explorers and how Singapore went from the 1800s onwards.  If you love learning about the history, this will be the place to go.  They also have a great little café and shop."
,,,,,,
Anthony P,9,Jan-20,Jan-20,50,Guided tour,Five Stars.  Very informative and worth while.  Cost reasonable and the information and learning opportunity was timely and valuable.
,,,,,,
Wongaburra,100,Jan-20,Jul-19,50,Informative and enjoyable,Always on the lookout for the history of where we were visiting the National Museum of Singapore was a must. We had booked a guided tour which was well worth the cost as the guide was informative and knowledgeable. Well worth the visit.
,,,,,,
ThiBRtravel,114,Jan-20,Jan-20,40,"Nice museum to lean about ""Sinhapura""","We visited this place few days ago.<br/><br/>When I compare the museums in other countries, this is a small museum with low number of exhibits, and that is understandable, considering the small size of the country.<br/><br/>Most of the exhibits focus on the last hundred years from World wars to the 2000s. However, there are few old exhibits as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, in my opinion they have done a good job with what they have.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the museum is the exhibits and descriptions about the recent development of Singapore, starting from 1950s. The commitment towards a well planned developed country is very inspirational. I strongly suggest this part of the Museum to visitors."
,,,,,,
Ruben R Mizrahi,"1,718",Jan-20,Apr-19,50,A must,This is the place to understand the History and some of the culture in Singapore.<br/>My suggestion is to make it your first stop when you arrive the city (after the airport and your hotel of course).
,,,,,,
Dan M,6,Jan-20,Jan-20,50,An excellent museum,I was shocked at how great this museum is. On the ground floor there is an excellent exhibit that showcases Singapore’s history. You can easily spend all day at the museum! If you are short on time don’t bother with the exhibits on the first floor as the ground floor is much more comprehensive.
,,,,,,
Lynne A,259,Jan-20,Jan-20,30,Cool area to wander and explore some history,Intersting history contained within the bottom level. Museum seemd disjointed though and hard to work out what our ticket did and did not include to visit. Not a free museum although some people were able to wander about with out tickets.
,,,,,,
Michael T,"1,020",Jan-20,Jan-20,40,Interesting Singaporean History,We spent a couple of hours here but should have allowed more time. The free one hour guided tour was very interesting and the Chinese lady who conducted it was very engaging. The celebration of the forest in the glass atrium was eye catching.
,,,,,,
Patmar2501,86,Jan-20,Dec-19,50,"We liked it, very informative.","perhaps a tad expensive for foreigners to visit (AUD $90 for a family of 4 all exhibit tickets) but we are glad we went. The exhibits were well laid out, informative and interactive. We were there at Christmas time so the free guided tours were not available but it was still great."
,,,,,,
shinf2016,68,Jan-20,Jan-20,40,The Speech of Lee Kuan Yew,"Could get the knowledge about the history of Singapore.  Although I frequented Singapore, I have missed this museum.  The most impressive part was the recorded video speech of the first PM of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew.  The resolution presented there when he decided to go apart from Malaysia, is still alive in the hearts of Singaporean."
,,,,,,
brigettimoog,23,Jan-20,Jan-20,10,There are better ways to spend your time,Everyone should be in agreement: the place is not worth visit<br/><br/>Four flights of empty space.  A large old building with non informative bad signages. The attendants looked busy with hand held devices. This place is boring
,,,,,,
Eva,3,Jan-20,Dec-19,50,Great experience,"Both the permanent and temporary exhibitions were worth while. Also, they make it interesting and interactive, and they offer daily free tours around for the ones who want to learn more!<br/>I you want to see it ALL and you are like me, who wants to get the best out of it, you will definetely need to spend the whole morning/afternoon there...although this is very personal and up to each person."
,,,,,,
Lord_Dehf,211,Jan-20,Jan-20,50, Hidden gem,"This was a hidden gem for me.  Much larger than I thought and tally good exhibitions. Skip the free guided tour though, it was good but to slow."
,,,,,,
Ms_R33480,578,Jan-20,Dec-19,50,Must see,"Excellent permanent exhibits of  history and development of Singapore, very comprehensive, modern and easy to navigate.<br/><br/>They also have special exhibits worth seeing , like the nature walk inside the museum.<br/><br/>Easy to get to by metro."
,,,,,,
mmlake,16,Jan-20,Dec-19,30,i had better expectations,musuem did not meet my expectations.  I still did not follow the history of singapore even after viewing.
,,,,,,
Dinah B,44,Jan-20,Dec-19,50,Gorgeous building with interesting historical exhibits,"Beautifully cool (aim to be in there during the heat of the day) and fascinatingly historically interesting - from the humble beginnings of Singapore (or Singapura) though to Colonial times, invasion during WW2 and Life in Singapore during the 50's, 60's and 70's."
,,,,,,
Cartertravels15,193,Dec-19,Nov-19,50,Great to visit and revisit,"We went again to this museum a favourite of ours.So much to see and not too many visitors in November.Before we hadn't been in to the basement and with our particular ticket we could ,well worth a visit.We hadn't realised that over 60's get a reduced fee for their ticket.Super cafe and very nice cakes and iced teas.Next time we are in Singapore definitely another trip to this museum with its beautiful architecture and spacious galleries.Everything is very well labelled."
,,,,,,
Tobias D,4,Dec-19,Dec-19,10,Take care of your belongings,"Take care of your belongings....my camera charge incl. battery was stolen in there while it was charging in the baselevel. Employees sent me through the museum, nobody seems to care about."
,,,,,,
NYKGMGTGSG,156,Dec-19,Nov-19,50,Love the history lesson!,"The National Museum offered us a great tour of the history of Singapore, its people and the melting pot culture that co-exists. What a delightful surprise you will have, the staid, conservative exterior is an interesting contrast tot he modern tour you take through the Museum. We especially enjoyed the special exhibit, visual extravaganza to delight your senses! I would recommend planning to spend a long afternoon here."
,,,,,,
BruceMcdou,74,Dec-19,Dec-19,40,well-structured museum,"Spent a morning here recently and ran out of time. The museum is structured in a chronological order from the basement (pre-history up to initial European contacts) to the first floor (colonial era) to the second floor (independence and modern era).  I'm the sort who wants to see and read everything and I really enjoyed it.  They also have ""kid friendly"" interactive exhibits and some recreations of a room, or part of a ship, that you can walk into and around.  Well done and well-structured."
,,,,,,
glee55,84,Dec-19,Dec-19,50,Very Educational,Well worth spending a few hours learning about Singapore history.  Recommend the free English speaking tour.
,,,,,,
raylynup,21,Dec-19,Dec-19,50,A most do,We had a wet morning to fill in and the museum was close to our hotel. What a brilliant experience we had. We learnt so much about the history of Singapore. So much to see and to learn about . The story of the forest is worth seeing if you have children very cleaver animation. The section on WW2 is very interesting as well. I would visit again
,,,,,,
Marlene5552015,15,Dec-19,Dec-19,50,Very informative. Great way to find out about Singapore. Interesting history. Staff very helpful. Service in cafe slow,Not cheap to view all exhibition. Great space. Would go back again. Excellent exhibitions. Staff very helpful
,,,,,,
BrianTaylor9,859,Dec-19,Nov-19,40,Great museum ,A somewhat hidden gem. this is a really nice place to visit if you are a tourist wanting to know more about singapore or a local who wants to be better informed. There is currently an exhibition on Raffles which is really interesting. Well worth a visit.  Singapore citizens and PR get free entry.
,,,,,,
ludor,"2,242",Dec-19,Nov-19,50,Great way to learn about Singapore,"The National Museum of Singapore is very complex, including many variate sections related to history, nature, culture, civil rights and so on. A great way to learn about and to better understand this unique country."
,,,,,,
Stephen U,82,Dec-19,Dec-19,30,Not as interesting as it could have been,"This, to my mind, was how not to run a museum; (though how too many museums are run these days.)  There was far too much emphasis on “interaction” and staging and not enough illumination and education for my (admittedly olf fashioned,) taste.  There were a lot of very good exhibits, and obviously a lot of very good intentions, but somehow it did not come together: too much staginess in some areas.  The Singapore History exhibition relied too much on dodgy sets and animations.  What was that walk down the spiral through the forest all about?  Poor quality CGI that, if it was telling a story, rather kept is hand well shielded.  Do animals mince?  I don’t think our negative reaction was just because we are old grumps: it did not seem to grab the attention of the kids either.<br/><br/>There was just too much trying hard.  Does the tragedy of the Syonan-to period really need a soundtrack of Japanese dive bombers and exploding bombs to get it across, or does that actually detract from the message?  Elsewhere, I am afraid I would have had the temerity to question the description of one or two items.  In the end we left thinking a return visit to the Asian Civilisations Museum would have been a better use of time."
,,,,,,
Marylnn Clarke,18,Dec-19,Dec-19,50,This helped us to understand the History of Singapore. Started here.,"This is where we started and the exhibition was very clear and helpful. Everything then fitted like a jigsaw puzzle when we visited Fort Canning, China Town, Raffles Place, Little India and explored this Wonderful island with so much history."
,,,,,,
Richard H,251,Dec-19,Dec-19,50,Worth a visit ,If you want to know about Singapore and it’s amazing history this is the place to go. If you want to really get everything out of your visit allow yourself a minimum of 2 hours. I lasted visited here more than 4 years ago but all the displays have either been updated or replaced
,,,,,,
Myla Person,2,Dec-19,Dec-19,50,National Museum is the place to go to understand Singapore,"In a quaint beautifully conserved building, the exhibitions inside elegantly narrate the Singapore story and journey from its discovery by the British empire in 1819, through the Japanese occupation in World War 2, independence from British, merger with Malaya, all through til modern day independent Singapore. <br/><br/>More than that, it also does great in portraying the life and culture of everyday Singaporeans. Until Mar 2020, they are also having ‘An Old New World’  exhibition covering the 700 years of history leading up to Britain’s discovery."
,,,,,,
Arlo Alexander,2,Dec-19,Dec-19,50,Interesting museum to visit !,This is an absolute must for visitors to Singapore as it sets out the history of the island to help put one's visit in context. The exhibits are displayed with great flair and imagination - it has to be one of the best museums I have visited. There are many audio visual displays which really help yo bring the history of this remarkable island to life.
,,,,,,
OzJohnno,119,Dec-19,Nov-19,40,Singapore History,"I have to admit that prior to our visit to this large and informative museum I knew very little about Singapore history prior to Raffles.  My eyes were opened to all aspects of the early history of Singapore.  This is a big building with many exhibits.  They had a digital display on during our visit called ""Story of the Forrest"".  This was incredible.  We spent over 3 hours wandering the halls and could hace spent more time.  If you want to learn a little about the country you're visiting then I recommend a visit to this museum."
,,,,,,
Angela B,82,Dec-19,Nov-19,50,Very well worth a full day visit,"If you want to know more about the eventful history of Singapore, this is definitely the place to go. The exhibion room are very well curated and the information provided is excellent"
,,,,,,
anitad168,23,Dec-19,Nov-19,40,History,The building is definately well worth a look in itself.  The museum tells the history of Singapore from its beginning to modern day.
,,,,,,
932Wolf932,14,Dec-19,Nov-19,50,Excellent,"Great remodelling job for SGD 530 Mio to put two historic buildings under one roof. Lots of space, perhaps a little bit underused. Take the free one-hour tour."
,,,,,,
sbp0713,138,Dec-19,Nov-19,50,You should go!,This museum correctly is regional in it’s focus.  Huge dollars have been plugged into the redo.  There is some world class art
,,,,,,
kathrynhelen3,29,Nov-19,Nov-19,50,"Beautiful museum, fascinating exhibits","Beautiful museum, elegant colonial building dating from 1887, 50th year of Queen Victoria’s reign in neo-Palladian style, contrasted with light and airy modern addition plus subterranean exhibition spaces carved from beneath Fort Canning hill. Loved the few hours we spent here. Started with tour. Excellent guide, really engaging and knowledgeable. Fantastic overview of how Singapore has changed over the past 700 years. All the exhibitions were really well done, beautifully and clearly presented. Really increased my understanding of modern Singapore. Highly recommend a visit!"
,,,,,,
2GuysSW,174,Nov-19,Aug-19,50,Wonderful museum,We didn’t have time to visit here on our first visit to Singapore so it was a ‘must-do’ for this trip. The building is impressive from the outside and no less so inside. It offers a huge area for wonderful displays and exhibitions telling the history of Singapore and its people. The Singapore History Gallery was our favourites and we also enjoyed the Modern Colony and the Story of the Forest exhibitions. There are several permanent exhibitions plus others that change throughout the year. You really do need to allow several hours to enjoy this museum fully. We did our own thing for most of our visit but we also booked one of the excellent guided tours around the Singapore History Gallery – I wish that the lady guide had been my history teacher at school as she was just so enthusiastic and proud of Singapore. I would definitely visit again as you can’t take it all in on just one visit. Highly recommended.
,,,,,,
Ellie1145,"1,027",Nov-19,Oct-19,50,What an amazing museum!,"We visited this museum for the first time and were pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>It is housed in a magnificent white colonial style building and has a number of exciting and informative exhibitions.<br/><br/>As my father-in-law was captured by the Japanese  in Singapore in WW2 we were particularly interested in the story of Singapore and its subsequent capture.<br/><br/>We thought the exhibitions were very well thought out and the artefacts displayed were extremely interesting.<br/><br/>The museum is a huge building which marries the old with the new. The architecture is stunning.<br/><br/>We had lunch in the lovely ‘Food for Thought’ cafeteria, which was excellent.<br/><br/>This museum is well worth a visit and we will certainly return should we be in Singapore again."
,,,,,,
WanderfullNancy,91,Nov-19,Nov-19,40,Worth the visit,"A detailed and interesting walk through Singapore’s history. Nice mix of artifacts, photos, paintings, video, audio. There was a docent-led tour, but we missed it because we didn’t know about it. What we overheard was informative and would have added value to the whole experience, so ask about it when you go. There was also a surprisingly compelling small photographic exhibit of S’pore trees, and a small exhibit outlining what Singapore has done to achieve gender equality, notable women, etc. The 2-3 hours spent here enhanced our understanding and appreciation of Singapore."
,,,,,,
anitakanjee,30,Nov-19,Nov-19,40,Wonderful!,Easily accessed with the MRT. Staff at the Reception desk were very helpful. This museum has a wealth of knowledge of past and present Singapore. Beautifully show-cased.
,,,,,,
AlabamaAnne,218,Nov-19,Nov-19,50,Fun to learn about the history of Singapore,"This was our favorite museum in Singapore. Learned much about the history, culture, and very impressed with the first Prime Minister, Mr. Lee."
,,,,,,
blairkk25,"1,978",Nov-19,Oct-19,40,I liked the history part of the museum,"I visited the National Museum of Singapore in October 2019.  I had been here once before in 2016 and decided to return.  You can get here by the MRT (subway) by going to Dhoby Gaut and then walking.  It is a little hard to find so ask for directions.  I focused on the History Gallery although the museum offers a lot more.  The History Gallery covers the founding of Singapore by Raffles, World War 2 and the Japanese occupation, the leadership and contributions of Lee Kuan Yew, and many other things.  After the History Gallery there is an exhibit on Singapore's economic data which was very interesting.  There were a lot of other things to see in the museum but unfortunately I did not have time.  Maybe my next time in Singapore."
,,,,,,
Collegepathss,"1,006",Nov-19,Nov-19,50,Fascinating - A Must visit and a great escape from the weather ,We are still talking about our visit and it has been a week. The museum is exceptionally well done and I highly recommend taking a tour. Our tour guide was super and handled a large group extremely well. The museum does a beautiful job of showing how what was happening in Singapore over 500 years tied into other parts of the globe. There were all ages on our tour and everyone was engaged. I want to also mention that I needed a wheelchair (I came on a knee scooter and wasn’t allowed to take it inside). The staff provided a wheelchair and were really helpful and friendly. This was perhaps my 8-10th visit to Singapore but first to the museum. I would return happily. It is large and could take a full day. 2 restaurants on site.
,,,,,,
CadigalSydney,210,Nov-19,Oct-19,40,Must Visit,"An excellent museum depicting the history of this amazing little country.<br/>A museum which Singaporeans can be justly proud.<br/>The modern architectural features added to the already magnificent neo-Palladian and Renaissance style building is simply superb, well worth a visit."
,,,,,,
DarlingOO7,34,Nov-19,Nov-19,50,Not your average museum,"Allow approx 3 hours.  This museum is not your average museum and it takes you through so much history, but not in a boring way.  Was really enjoyed and I highly recommend."
,,,,,,
geoffheath6,25,Nov-19,Oct-19,50,Superb,Well worth a visit...history of Singapore is very poignant certainly an eye opener.<br/>Unable to comprehend how they were treated during the war.
,,,,,,
00RSN00,61,Nov-19,Oct-19,50,The ‘Syonan’ exhibition was great,"A great place. They even had what was named ‘Quiet Mondays’; As per what I understood, if you go there early morning on Mondays, your visit will be quiet and peaceful as there won’t be guided tours. The ‘Syonan’ exhibition (Japanese annexation of Singapore) is in my view… A must!"
,,,,,,
BTMS11,13,Nov-19,Oct-19,50,Traveler,We have excellent guide who helped us explain us history of Singapore and also help us to enjoy in the Museum. Museum is overall excellent organized and very interesting.
,,,,,,
MichaelJT19,400,Nov-19,Nov-19,50,One of better museums,Went here on a Monday and the price was 26 dollars for entry. Took one of the free guided tours by an american lady (pretty interesting insight on old pre colonial singapore) and visited the rest of the rooms there. Would recommend
,,,,,,
Sujeewa W,651,Nov-19,Oct-19,50,Must see place,Located at very convenient place. Open till 7.00pm . Highly recommend for travelers who want to see the S'pore history
,,,,,,
jill58PooleUK,27,Oct-19,Oct-19,40,Tells the real story of the start of the Island,Very interesting few hours spent getting to understand the bigger picture of the birth of this tiny great nation... from before the visiting East India power house to the true birth of the nation with the power and genuine desire of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.. what a great man .... and what a great legacy he created.... give it a go and see for yourself....
,,,,,,
Trish9amanda,33,Oct-19,Sep-19,50,Well worth the visit,"When visiting a city, I like to visit the museum so that I can find out about the city's past and I found this museum to be excellent. The information and films around WWII were very good."
,,,,,,
prachi_mtl,97,Oct-19,Oct-19,50,A dose of history!,The museum tells Singapore's different periods of history through brilliantly curated exhibits. I saw WWII from the 'Eastern' point of view for the first time and it was enlightening.<br/>The standard entrance fee is S$15 and it's worth every cent.<br/>Highly recommended!
,,,,,,
TableCrow,183,Oct-19,Oct-19,50,Museum trip,Excellent historical overview of Singapore. Well organised displays in chronological order. Easy to reach by MRT.
,,,,,,
sbtaeter,89,Oct-19,Oct-19,50,One of the best museums so far,This museum really knows how to prepare information and artefacts to catch the visitor's attention. It's very easy to follow the history of Singapore step by step and not to lose interest. The visuals are well selected and the information texts kept short but still including all the necessary information.<br/>It also shows some films where it is the best medium of choice and I must say that I have learned so much in just one day here. <br/>Would definitely recommend going here.
,,,,,,
Namcy C,162,Oct-19,Oct-19,30,Great if you are interested in Singapore history,"You can skip this if you want to explore antique or history other than Singapore's.<br/>Price of icket is varied by the gallery, anyway there is an option for all-you-can-visit ticket. Anyway the presentation here is quite creative with effect and audio.<br/>They even have a global photography show which is interesting."
,,,,,,
Mrs Carol G,129,Oct-19,Oct-19,40,Great way to find out about Singapore’s History,"Super museum well set out charts the history of Singapore to the present day, spent much longer than expected here as really informative and interesting.  Glass tower was a bit strange but probably great if you have children"
,,,,,,
Wind4surf,92,Oct-19,Sep-19,50,Stunning watercolors and other artwork!,"My wife and I visit art museums worldwide and were pleasantly surprised wih the breadth and quality of the collections. The watercolor exhibit opened our eyes to the subtlties of the medium in a way we never thought possible. We discovered artists we never knew existed who painted in ways reminiscent of Renoir, Pollack, Matisse, Picasso, etc. There was too much to see in one day while jet-lagged, and we regret not having more time to spend there."
,,,,,,
RandolphCarter1919,322,Oct-19,Oct-19,50,Quality museum,"We called in here late one day and the help desk recommended we come back another day as it was late, we managed to arrive back again on the 132nd anniversary of the museum so everything was free. Good museum with different exhibitions on Singapore, some highlights were the occupation history, opium den and the local stories about trees. Overall a great place to hang out for a day."
,,,,,,
Prof. Andrew John y Fernandes,789,Oct-19,Oct-19,40,Good museum,"Well kept and has a great voyaging section. But as a young nation, nothing ancient or amazing to see"
,,,,,,

ossiegirls,62,Oct-19,Oct-19,50,Learnt heaps about old and recent Singapore. ,"Had a wonderful visit to the National Museum of Singapore today. Usually I struggle to spend more than 2 hours at an exhibition but today we were there for 4 1/2 hours. We really loved the “An Old New World” exhibition (there until March 2020) but also loved learning about Singapore’s history from spice port, colonisation, occupation to independence. Every display was well explained and had lots of interaction for all ages. All of the staff were really friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend a visit."
,,,,,,
junky10,43,Oct-19,Aug-19,50,Fascinating,"While in Singapore for a 2 week holiday we were talking to one of the staff at the hotel we were staying at, and it was suggested that we may like to visit this particular museum. I'm glad we listened, because the visit was fascinating with all the different articles to look at and a feature there that either of us have never seen anywhere else before. Sort of a spiraling downward picture show, hard to explain, but the type of thing that children would be fascinated in as well as adults."

Guest048,305,Oct-19,May-19,40,"Good overview of Singapore's past, present and thoughts for future","You will be advised to start on the top level, and work your way down levels to ground floor.  We came in the afternoon, and with hindsight, would have moved through the top floor more quickly and allowed more time for the ground floor to better absorb all of the information. Very well organised museum."

PipPaul W,"1,461",Oct-19,Oct-19,40,Very well done,"This is am excellent museum with a good balance between not too much / not too little information<br/><br/>They're are modernly curated galleries, and interesting displays.<br/><br/>Main issue is that some of the labelling is darkly lit and therefore difficult to read<br/><br/>Also, not cheap for what it is"
,,,,,,
Katie D,"1,189",Oct-19,Sep-19,40,Great intro to Singapore History,"The building is beautiful from the outside and also has an impressive atrium inside, which was bright and airy. The main exhibition is a great overview of how Singapore came to be the place it is today and is informative and interactive at times. Doesn't shy away from some of the challenging topics either. Other areas are well done too - the room which describes WWII activity and the light show were highlights. If you have a Singapore Airlines boarding pass, you get discount too."
,,,,,,
Arina,23,Oct-19,Oct-19,40,Beautiful building ,"I have to admit that the exhibitions weren’t as extensive and I assume its because Singapore isn’t an old country. But, the way the exhibitions were created made it very engaging and interactive. The architectural build of the museum itself was magnificent.<br/><br/>Inside, the museum was equipped with facilities for the less mobile. <br/><br/>It is also very accessible via MRT (I exited at Bencoolen station and walked about 5 minutes to reach the museum)"
,,,,,,
percy1nz,6,Oct-19,Sep-19,30,Over Rated,"I'll be generous and give this place three stars. Relative to most of the world, Singapore doesn't have extensive history and it shows. Much is made of Japanese occupation during the second world war. Museum layout is illogical and many exhibits lack innovation. If you're in Singapore for a week it's probably worth a look. Any shorter, I'd venture elsewhere."
,,,,,,
SquirrelAdvisor,64,Oct-19,Oct-19,50,Seriously one of the best,"The National Museum of Singapore shows the history (and current state) of Singapore in a very engaging way. Through very nicely themed areas filled with physical objects and all sorts of (multi)media displays, it tells the complete story of the city state. Instead of 'just showing' some old artefacts and objects, everything that is displayed helps to tell the story, making this one of the best national museums I have visited world wide."
,,,,,,
courtyalana,114,Oct-19,Sep-19,40,Quite Lovely,Great if you’re a traveller that loves to learn the history of the country you’re visiting. Allow a few hours to get through all the exhibits as there is plenty to see and read. Admission price is very reasonable at $26 per person.

ivanbeingblessed,111,Sep-19,Sep-19,40,"History Lessons, Anyone?","A must place to visit. There's different levels of attraction. It's always interesting knowing the history on each country. There's an exhibition just started recently and will last till March 2020. It's called ""an old new world."" Check that out."

Chrisinkingwood2,"5,091",Sep-19,Sep-19,50,Really a world class museum experience!,We do much enjoyed this museum. it was really clean and the exhibits were so well presented. We learned a lot about the long history of Singapore and the general region and how it moved from a tribal place to a British colony and then on to independence after WWII. The exhibits were very well displayed and lighted. Interesting how they attached a new modern building to the old one.

Megan McDonald,5,Sep-19,Sep-19,50,Nice museum love it...,"1st time here...trip was fruitful. But unfortunately, duration was short so didnt get to explore everything. Might visit again😁 A very informative place to visit. I went for the history of NTUC exhibition.👍"
,,,,,,
Benjamin I,304,Sep-19,Sep-19,40,Good Deep-Dive into Singapore's history!,"Great gallery on the 1st floor (this is the main gallery).  As someone with a short museum attention span, this was a good size.  Throughout the exhibit, you'll notice many displays reference ""Fort Canning Park"".  Once you're done with the museum, go outside and walk to Fort Canning Park (bordering the museum) to check it out for yourself and get some fresh air."
,,,,,,
Cathy H,168,Sep-19,Sep-19,50,Really helped me understand the History of Singapore,"Firstly this is a really beautiful building, cool, clean, quiet with friendly staff. I enjoy finding out about the history of the places I visit , especially how they came to be. We were fortunate that the new exhibition tracing Singapore’s origins from the 16th Century began the day we wanted to visit the museum. Even more fortunate that for the first two days, entry was free. <br/>The exhibition , is excellent and the most interactive part for children. I learnt so much about the role of the Dutch East Indies Company in founding trading places such places in Malay and Singapore. <br/>The exhibition uses original maps, artefacts, information boards, audio accounts and paintings. Also a large prow of a ship to stand on and I learned to tie sailors knots.<br/>We spent about two hours in this exhibition and then had lunch in the cafeteria which was very good. Prices as you would expect for this type of venue.<br/>We then ‘did’ the rest of the museum which took another four hours. I now feel so much better informed about everything. <br/>If you really love history spend all day here. If you just have a passing interest there are many other specific areas to focus on, such as the Japanese occupation or the changes to the lives of women.<br/>All in all, brilliant."

Ghadeer2014,"8,624",Sep-19,Sep-19,50,1849,I visited The National Museum of Singapore; it is the oldest museum in Singapore. Its history dates back to 1849. It is open Daily 10 am to 7 pm. The time line shown is easily followed by visitors. The time line starts when Singapore was a fishing village until it became a global city. The exhibition is well arranged and surely great for students. <br/><br/>SEE photos.

Neale1810,"2,453",Sep-19,Sep-19,50,Learn the history of Singapore,We are not really museum people but have recently started to understand the history of places we are visiting. This National Museum does a great job in that respect.<br/><br/>We had just missed the 1100 guided tour so did it ourselves instead. We walked round the historical exhibits and it gave us an excellent journey through the history of Singapore - we were particularly interested in how it starts with Raffles in 1819 through to the independence in 1965. The exhibits did a good job in explaining this.<br/><br/>Really enjoyed the visit and appreciated the AC to cool us down. With our tourist pass it cost 13 SGD to get in ($2 discount.

,,,,,,
ECWorld,"2,571",Sep-19,Sep-19,40,Informative - worth a look if interested in history of Singapore,"Well Singapore does not have a long history or a world class collection, but the folks at the museum try hard to make it an informative experience for the visitor and generally do okay.  Lots of information on the rather short history of the nation; probably a bit too much resulting in rather cramped exhibits and too much stuff in the same room.  There is also a multimedia show in the glass rotunda - best for small kids. The garden with local fauna is probably worth a quick look.  There are also special exhibitions going on, worth a quick look - generally well organized and informative.  Though a reasonably good museum, not really worth a special trip unless you are interested in the history of the nation."
,,,,,,
Neil W,20,Sep-19,Sep-19,30,Colony building with contemporary displays,"The museum is worth a visit, even just to step inside and away from the humidity for a few hours. <br/>While I found most things interesting enough to read through the story behind the artifact, the new laser type displays don't do much for me. <br/>Yet you do get an excellent understanding of the history behind the country."
,,,,,,
Njbella154943,111,Sep-19,Aug-19,50,A lot of history,"Before going to Singapore, I did a bit of digging to know more about the country. But this museum delivers a deep detailed history that I couldn't find online. I was very impressed with all the details and the tons of information available. This visit helped me see Singapore differently and I loved every hour spent there."
,,,,,,
Scott G,229,Sep-19,Aug-19,40,Excellent historical reviews of Singapore,This is a museum where you walk through it with enjoyment and learn; it is airy and modern -- without glass cases of old relics.   It's a great mix of old and new.
,,,,,,
sinclaired,279,Sep-19,Aug-19,50,Really worth a visit!,My visit coincided with Singapore’s National Day celebrating 54 years as an independent state and admission was free. Many families took advantage of the offer and the museum had established a range of activities and one-off exhibitions for the occasion. <br/>Two exhibitions took my interest most. The History of Singapore gave a most informative and evocative coverage. The Story of the Forest comprised a digital representation - visual and auditory - of the wildlife and environment of the Malay peninsula since the 19th century. This exhibition is located on level 2 of the rotunda and takes advantage of the circularity of the building’s space.<br/>Highly recommended for a visit.

Christine C,13,Aug-19,Aug-19,30,Interesting but only if you have plenty of time,"There was nothing overly exciting for me to see there but if you are interested in museums, want to get out of the heat and are really into Singapore's history than it will be the right place for you. Else you might be better off spending your time with things you are more interested in."

Cultural insight I was privileged to relive as people of Singapore told their stories.  They have a free volunteer tour guide who takes you threw all the ages and history from the inception of the first Prince to more modern day Singapore.  Loved every minute and enjoyed seeing all the relics many centuries old.

Jennifer F,7,Aug-19,Aug-19,50,National Museum - Singapore,The National Museum was very interesting. We went in around 345pm and Gallery 10 closes at 5pm so we did that first and then worked our way from upstairs to level 1. Very engaging and exhibits are well labelled and flowing. No boring stuff at all and gives a very good history of Singapore.

Tippyleaf,130,Aug-19,Aug-19,50,A great introduction to Singapore,Beautiful building inside and out. Wonderful displays all clearly labelled in English. Follows the history of Singapore focusing on the last 200 years or so .  Spent 3 very pleasant hours there. Nice cafe for a light lunch .  We were so engrossed we missed the free guided tour which I understand was very good . <br/>Well worth a visit

Cacilia,124,Aug-19,Aug-19,50,Terrific museum ,We spent several hours here. It was so interesting understanding the history of Singapore and the region.

Would love to go back for another visit.

Claire S,6,Aug-19,Aug-19,50,Unexpectedly informative and very interesting,"On my last morning in Singapore I decided to go to the museum, and my goodness I am so glad that I didn’t miss it. The history of Singapore is incredibly interesting all the way from the 1800-present which is highlighted within the exhibition. It truly made me reflect on my holiday and how magnificent the city truly is. The museum itself is spotless and the exhibits themselves are pristine. The interactive exhibits where you can watch small clips or listen to audio clips just add to the layers of stories and a greater understanding of how Singapore came to be. The highlight on WWII was unbiased and displayed facts and real accounts which was refreshing. This place is a must visit!"
,,,,,,
James & Michael,56,Aug-19,Aug-19,50,A pristine museum showcasing all things Sinapore!,"We absolutely loved the National Museum! We were pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a student discount ($10 rather than $15), and there are free guided tours in multiple languages. This museum showcases Singapore history from start to finish, through its discovery, to the world war, and ends with modern day knowledge. There are also a few exhibits which display the artistic capabilities of the museum."
,,,,,,
Wonder A,382,Aug-19,Aug-19,40,Singapore history,"It has been more than 10 years since I last visited the National Museum and was amazed with its new look. Of interest were the four gallaries spanning the past 100 years: Modern Colony, Surviving Syonan, Growing up and Voices of Singapore where snapshorts of everyday life throughout the different eras of Singapore history were displayed. <br/>The other interesting areas were: Singapore History Gallery; Singapore, very old tree; Goh Seng Choo Gallery: Magic &amp; Menance; Story of the Forest."

The video interviews with Lee Quan Yew were incredible, as were the small items found from the very early populations that used to live here.  The Japanese occupation story was well told but I did feel that some of the atrocities were a bit glossed over.  A beautiful building with very helpful staff."

Schaper-Lim,438,Jul-19,Jul-19,50,Great place to gain an understanding of Singapore and its people ,"In the renovated/ restored National Library meeting, the extension is harmonious with the old (Burra charter). The exhibition about its past well curated"
,,,,,,
FyingKiwi,704,Jul-19,Jul-19,40,Singapore History With Dessert,"Museum has a very impressive display outlining Singapore's history, focusing largely upon political movements prior to the Japanese invasion, and the invasion itself, which cannot help but raise questions about how the British failed to protect one of its own colonies. Much of what Lee Kuan Yew, who became Singapore's Prime Minister following the Japanese surrender, said did echoes very much Singapore's post incursion and determination to create a nation of independence. What is displayed in this museum provides very clear evidence of this history.<br/>An absolutely delightful added attraction in the museum is a gallery (open only at certain times), which features an emphasis on forest conservation. The display also includes an unquestionably beautiful sensory experience within the ""Glass Rotunda""."

,,,,,,
ShaunH290,"1,101",Jul-19,Jun-19,40,The Building is a Gem!,"We approached the museum from the rear - from Fort Canning Park - and the modern annex is huge and airy. The first display was a  sinuous curve of very detailed text about the trades unions and their part in independence - I tried, but it was far too much to read. We walked over the Glass Passage connecting the two parts of the museum.<br/><br/>The free exhibits included large rooms on the history of Singapore, including one devoted to the Japanese occupation. It is interesting reading some of the comments here by Japanese tourists. They generally do not know much about it at all. NMS has a mandate to explain the recent history of the country and it does that well.<br/><br/>Some of the exhibits on other aspects are underwhelming. We did not, on that basis, pay for tickets to the other parts of the museum. However, the original Victorian building is a gem! We were only in Singapore for a few days, but it was worth seeing the dome from the inside first and then seeing the façade from the road last. Truly a treasure worth maintaining but it struggles to compete on the world stage of national museums."
,,,,,,
aussiechristopher,34,Jul-19,Jul-19,50,Always Excellent,"This was our hird visit over the years and the Museum just keeps getting better - this time we took two of our granddaughters on their first overseas trip - they were blown away by the exhibits and, in particular, the Story of the Forest and Surviving Syonan exhibitions as well as the amazing tecnological display in the Glass Rotunda."

Well, thinking of the history of Singapore, probably this museum has interesting items. But most of them were pretty modern collections. You may be able to find similar items in your garage. This place may be interesting for people who want to learn about Singapore, but not exciting for people who want to enjoy art or old things."

KBenno,24,Jun-19,Jun-19,50,Excellent Museum and Cafe,"Well worth a visit to help put Singapore into context and understand where it has come from. We attended just as a tour was commencing which we were recommended to join (for free) so we did. The tour was led by a volunteer who was extremely well informed and good. The museum is beautifully laid out and presented - some really interesting exhibits and just enough information. The exhibitions are all good - on the first floor the exhibition dealing with the history of Singapore is probably the main one and definitely worth visiting, taking you from the 12c ? through the main different cultures that make up Singapore, through the 2WW with some very interesting artefacts if not gruesome reminders and then on to independence and the subsequent growth of Singapore into where it is today. Would also recommend the cafe in the museum - good value and very good quality food if a little laid back in service it's worth the wait."

manupete,76,Jun-19,Apr-19,50,Excellent presentation of the history of Singapore,"The layout takes you through a well presented history, with little rooms and spaces laid out to show the different periods and the different social and racial mix and their customs, lifestyles and working conditions - e.g. opium dens and the growth of the city and the WW11 period."

Wonder,272,Jun-19,Jun-19,40,Excellent interactive Musuem,"Though this might not  be the first time we have gone to the musuem, my kids still love it coz they always have new themes and exhibits. The current theme is very suitable for kids (just curious). <br/><br/>My girls aged 8 and 10 loved all the 4 themes. They had fun with the gigantic puzzles, weighing the anchor, fixing back the vases and of course the bouncy castle and interactive in the Stories of Forest. I forgot to mentioned  they loved drawing and colouring their toy and get to play some of the traditional games. <br/><br/>I have also bought the interactive guidebook which they enjoyed working on it and reading it whenever they saw the artefact in the permanent gallery. We have not finished with the entire book in the musuem and do intent to visit the musuem once again to finish up the remaining activies.<br/><br/>Overall, recommended for all to go."

Michael G,"1,357",Jun-19,Apr-19,50,So much to see,"I arrived just as a guided highlights tour was starting and I joined that. For the next 75 mins, a pleasant Aussie docent led us around the main gallery and gave us a whirlwind history of Singapore of pre-Raffles, through the inter-Raffles colonial years and onward to the World War 2 bit of which I was now well acquainted. <br/><br/>After the war was also covered nicely if briefly showing the 2 year dalliance with, and subsequent divorce of, Malaysian unification, gaining its own national identity and the whole HDB slash green area initiatives by first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew that has made Singapore the green concrete jungle (in both senses of that word) that it is today. It was kind of a neat way of tying up my whole experience of Singapore.<br/><br/>After the tour, I wandered around by myself to catch up on some of the reading and watching, but would highly recommend the tour - maybe try to get  a quieter tour, ours was so large we couldn't get into some of the rooms."

scottofhawaii,"4,509",May-19,May-19,50,What you'd expect...,"...from a National Museum.  Actually it kind of started out on a bit of a (I'm really struggling for a word here) unexpected note.  After purchasing my ticket, I was directed to an escalator that took me to the the top of the building's rotonda where you wind your way back down viewing a digital display of a forest (which I guess is Singapore back in the day).  It was certainly colorful, visually pleasing, and the kids running back and forth seemed to love it.  I guess for me, when I go to a museum (especially a national one), I'm expecting to see realia as opposed to basically digital animation.  Then again, it's a nice wow factor for the kids. That didn't last long as you find yourself on the bottom floor in the main historical gallery of the museum covering the breadth of Singapore's history.  Here is where I found the great displays and information panels I wanted.  Too much to go into about what is displayed, but my visit to the museum today left me a question in my mind.  A big part of the main historical gallery covers both the British colonial period as well as the Japanese occupation during WWII.  There is even a separate display about the Japanese occupation; I believe it was on the second floor of the museum.  What I found interesting was that these displays on the Japanese occupation really bring to life the horror that occurred during this period.  Yet for the most part, the British colonial is sort of viewed through rose-colored glasses.  Yes there are disturbing displays about things such as how the colonial British ""encouraged"" opium addiction, but I would think colonial occupation to be just as horrific, maybe even more debilitating, and certainly more insidious then a much shorter period of wartime occupation.  I am certainly not trying to minimize the responsibility of the Japanese for their war crimes, it's just that I left the museum wondering why the scope of the British colonial period is not viewed in a similar manner."

These exhibits are a well-curated set of objects and subtle digital effects. <br/>The food an beverage offerings are quite good and the staff throughout the museum were unfailingly welcoming and helpful."

Bluesphynx,"1,113",May-19,May-19,40,Updated history of Singapore ,"As Singaporeans, we get free admission so it's a good idea to come every now and again to view the temporary exhibitions and see how the permant galleries are updated. Was very pleased to find that the history of Singapore had additional and interesting information on the surrender of Singapore, the Japanese Occupation and the separation of Singapore from Malaysia. Even more gratified to find the presentation of facts objective and non-controversial, very fair to all parties and countries involved, but details certainly giving rise to individual responses eg presentation of the Tiger of Malaya, General Yamashita, his trial and execution, the Sook Ching Massacre, Lee Kuan Yew's arguments for merger with Malaysia. There was a very good docent guiding at 11am and while not part of the group, overheard her insightful and humorous commentary which was much appreciated by the visitors.<br/>Found the temporary exhibition on 'Packaging' nostalgic, and the items, eg F n N bottles, posters well-sourced and preserved. Also enjoyed again the Enchanted Forest with the digitalized walk imaginatively put together with lovable small creatures, colorful flora and even tropical rain and melodic sounds.<br/>However, it's rather confusing finding your way around and the restrooms' signage is incredibly difficult to identify especially as the one near the entrance has been usurped by ' Food for Thought' , this food outlet looking rather uninviting with over-priced Western fare. Better to walk a bit to Food Republic across the road for delicious local fare."

plspoon,548,May-19,May-19,30,The layout is a little confusing,Although I looked at the brochure/map I still found it a little confusing to follow the best way to see this museum.  We seemed to start at the most recent time and work our way back and I would have thought it would be better the other way around but didn't figure it out.  We got a Seniors discount on entry so it cost us $10 each.  It is located in a beautiful building.  Give it a go if you have spare time.

Aikane B,106,Apr-19,Mar-19,50,Wonderful information on history of Singapore,"The National Museum of Singapore is fairly small by museum standards, but it is full of information.  There is an amazing exhibit going through the history of Singapore from day “one” to current times.  There is so much more to their history than I ever could have imagined.  I spent 90 minutes walking through this exhibit and didn’t touch on a lot of it.  There was also a neat exhibit regarding conservation, which I didn’t take any photos of but did take a number of videos.  Singapore is definitely onboard with saving the planet!  This exhibit used film and animation to produce it’s intended effect and it did not disappoint.  I would highly recommend a visit here if you are interested in the history of Singapore! And skip the people at the beginning trying to sell you a tour, I don’t think it is necessary given the size of the museum, though I guess they could have some insights having lived there."

mo_aiguille,"1,671",Apr-19,Apr-19,40,Very nice museum,I thought it was a really good hour spent there. For the first 20 mins I was fascinated but then it just got too much for me.<br/>Looking at the history of Singapore the stuff they have from the war even a tank which I found fascinating. Some of the drawings as well were really good.<br/>I think for kids it will be a bit too much and boring. It’s more for adults.<br/>For adults there is a charge as well of 15SGD if you are a non resident.

Dheer Sanghi,7,Apr-19,Apr-19,50,"National Museum of Singapore - Magic and Menace Gallery, Glass Rotunda exhibition, and 700 Years of Singapore History","With a history dating back to its inception in 1887, the National Museum of Singapore is the nation’s oldest and biggest museum. The famous big rotunda with a stunning dome is just a part of the great architecture that makes the building so special. Located on the bustling Orchard Road, this museum is right at the center of Singapore. NMS is designed like a British colonial building, as it was built for Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee. <br/><br/>I visited 2 tours with an FOM docent during my time at the National Museum. The first one was a gallery called Magic and Menace. This gallery contained watercolor paintings that were commissioned by Singapore’s first British Resident, William Farquhar. He was so amazed at the tropical landscape, that he commissioned Chinese artists to draw/paint the flora and fauna of the Malay archipelago. There are also tribal tools, products, and artifacts, even dead animals, from Farquhar’s collection. The reason the gallery is named “Magic and Menace”, is because of the supernatural beliefs of the locals at that time. They believed in spirits, especially in animals and plants. So, depending on whether there were good or evil spirits, they could create magic or be a menace! Another interesting feature of this gallery were the “smell jars” in which you could smell Jasmine, Durian, Nutmeg, and the Yellow Champaka flower. This made the tour a multi-sensory discovery experience of the religions, customs, and cultures of the local Malays in the 1800s. <br/><br/>We continued on into another mesmerizing experience titled “Story of the Forest”. Sixty-nine of Farquhar’s paintings have been converted into a large, 3D digital panorama, creating a view of the Jungles of Melaka. The lifelikeness of the displays is complete with animation, music, and sound, and invites you to interact with the wildlife of the Malay peninsula in the 19th century up close. <br/><br/>The second tour on “The 700 Year History Of Singapore” was about the journey of Singapore to get where it is today. As our docent said, “Most Singaporeans think their history is 200 years old, but in actuality, they will be surprised as to how long the formation of Singapore has taken”. <br/><br/>This tour takes us through four distinct periods in Singapore’s life: Singapura (1299 – 1818), Crown Colony (1819 – 1941), Syonan-To (1942 – 1945), and Singapore (1945 – present). From being a sleepy fishing town to a British colony to part of the Japanese Pacific expansion, to finally getting freedom, the tour highlights the culture, trade, political situation at each stage. It tells you what it means to be a Singaporean, and Singapore’s national identity. Complete with life-sized models, this tour is completely immersive and takes you right to the nation’s defining moments in history. We were told that “nothing in Singapore’s history happened by chance; every move was thought out and well planned. That is how Singapore came to where it is today.” <br/><br/>The NMS is a museum central to Singapore and is custodian of the 11 National Treasures. It is supported by a wide range of facilities and services including F&amp;B, retail, and a Resource Centre. A cultural and architectural landmark in Singapore, the Museum hosts festivals and events all year round—the Night Festival, performances and film screenings, and more—in addition to presenting interesting exhibitions involving important collections of artifacts. This museum is one you shouldn’t miss! <br/><br/>Some interesting quotes by the tour guides:<br/><br/>“Nothing in Singapore’s history happened by chance, and every move was thought out and well planned. That is how Singapore came to where it is today.”<br/><br/>“Through the eye of William Farquhar, we are able to see the beauty of Melaka and the Malay Peninsula, geographically, and biologically.”"

I would particularly recommend the Singapore history gallery and the circle of life in the rotunda. <br/>The packaging exhibit is also very good. <br/>You do have to pay for access to all exhibits but there are some which are free and the cost for full access is very reasonable. <br/>Highly recommend a visit but allow plenty of time as there is a lot to see.

Rebecca B,82,Apr-19,Feb-19,40,Good but tourists have to pay!,"Wasn't expecting to have to pay to enter the National Museum as most big museums in the UK are free to enter but with a voluntary donation so we were unsure about whether to continue with our visit. <br/><br/>The exhibits are definitely worth spending half a day at if you're interested in the history of Singapore right from the early settlers, through the war to modern Singapore. There's a good range of interactive exhibits and different things to see. <br/><br/>The main exhibition downstairs is a little confusing to navigate at first, I was unsure which order I was meant to go round the exhibit in but once you're through to the WW2 section it's much better layed out. <br/><br/>It's fantastically cool inside, enough so that I actually ended up being cold! Perhaps take an additional layer. Didn't eat at the museum as there's a food court just down by Bras Basah MRT."

It's like walking through stories, basically their numerous historical/regional zones, with a very smooth flow, with an extremely immersive experience. The Rotunda is a simple yet fun place for kids and adults alike to experience Singapore's fauna and flora. They also have seasonal exhibitions which truly livens up the whole place with the interactive pieces (e.g. many old games brought back to life as interactive exhibits!), and also brings some truly rare exhibits to Singapore (e.g. wedding traditions and gowns throughout the world and ages).<br/><br/>Never get bored of this place.

There was a minimalist exhibition on when I was there and each to there own it was just that.  The exhibition by the artist, Lim was magnificent, showing those with talent don’t need to be minimalist.  Other works of art included beautiful sculptures and paintings outlining the history of Singapore and events that shaped this nation. <br/><br/>The law courts now connected by sky bridges are quite fascinating, you see the many areas, objects and manuscripts that guided and controlled Singapore. <br/><br/>Go for it all but especially go for the architecture."

Well set out and detailed.<br/>I joined a guided tour in Englidh that took ab out an hour, then I went back and covered the parts It missed out and those it covered that i wanted to see and read in more detail.<br/>In an expensive city this was excellent value and well worth a few hours of the day"

Nangavaram R,236,Mar-19,Feb-19,50,Exellent display of Old Singapore History to colonial occupation and Modern Singapore,"The Museum has a variety of exhibit starting with early settlers of Singapore, then occupation by Dutch, English East India Company, joining of Malaysian Federation, then declaration of Independence by then Premier Lee Quan . The city is built by Indian convicts who were deported by the British to Singapore. They settled in an area called Little India, many of the decedents are now traders, businessmen and Politicians. The majority Chinese lives in harmony with Indians, Malays and other Nationality and city is an example of community harmony."

AliKeane,375,Mar-19,Mar-19,50,Surprisingly excellent ,"We had an afternoon to fill and were staying in nearby Bugis so decided to walk to the museum. My suggestion would be to only pay for the special exhibit if it especially interests you; the Polaroid theme seemed like it would be good but was a bit underwhelming. The regular history section on level 1 was spectacular. To me, it has the perfect mix of information panels, displays, videos and enough to keep you interested. The modern section was especially well done. We really enjoyed learning more about Singapore and how it came to be the place it is today. Also liked the glass rotunda which was unique and fascinating. We spent about 2 hours here and it was worth the visit!"
,,,,,,
Kahunaminor,8,Mar-19,Mar-19,50,Not to be missed,"My family and I had a three day stopover in Singapore. This was high on the TripAdvisor list and did not disappoint. I must admit, I was a little vague on the history of Singapore but this laid it all out in a logical and interesting manner. Level 1 gave you an overview from the 1400’s to now. Level 2 focused on more specific areas such as early colonial times, the Japanese occupation of WW II, the 60’s and the rise of Singapore as a nation. Staff were very well versed and helpful. If you only have a short time in Singapore, put the NMS on your list."

AnInspectorCalls_Rob,427,Mar-19,Mar-19,50,Really good,"I first came here six years ago, and remember it to be outstanding. It has changed since then (or I have forgotten completely), so it was well worth revisiting.<br/><br/>I didn’t bother with the special exhibitions. But the main ones tell the story of Singapore from the 14th century through to the present day. The surprise surrender of the British in 1941 and the tough period of Japanese occupation until the end of World War II, which eventually culminated in full independence in 1965, is well told.<br/><br/>Upstairs, there are four smaller galleries which tell you how the people of Singapore experienced different periods of history - from the lively 1920s and 30s, through to the explosion of modernity in the 1970s and 80s.<br/><br/>I spent just over two hours here in total. And metres away from the helter skelter shopping district on Orchard Road, it was good to learn Singapore’s real story (again)."

Lindsay2882,100,Feb-19,Feb-19,50,First rate museum,"So much to see here.

Hans and Anna,4,Feb-19,Dec-18,50,memorable experience!,"In the cool setting of the National Museum it is easy to while away half a day or more. First thing to note is the setting. An excellent example of a historical building interacting with a modern annex providing a glorious space to wander within.<br/><br/>Remember - if you have a recent Singapore Airlines boarding pass you could be eligible for additional savings. I received a 50% discount on the SGD$10 admission price.<br/><br/>The main gallery to visit is the History of Singapore using the interactive companion providing audio and visual information. The wealth of information available on this set is huge. Almost every exhibit in this section will have a number next to it and when input into the companion more data is provided be it audio, text, or video. There is actually too much information and you do have to be selective on what information you're interested in else you'll be there to closing time."

MissCelaneus,98,Feb-19,Jan-19,40,Historical building and Museum,"Worth the visit for the building's architecture in itself. It's a welcome respite in the ultra-modern glass jungle of center city. The collections are not extraordinary, but they are very well presented, the light is carefully thought out, and the rooms are esthetically pleasing. <br/>I didn't find the history of the island very well explained, if anything it made me buy a history book at the bookshop."
,,,,,,
Vincent M,"2,042",Feb-19,Mar-18,40,"Worth a Visit, Perhaps","I have good news and bad news.  The good news is the National Museum of Singapore’s historic precedence over every other national museum in Southeast Asia. The NMS, then called the Raffles Museum, was founded in 1849.   Its closest competitor, Indonesia’s museum, dates from 1862.  The Thais opened theirs in 1874;  the Cambodians in 1920; the Burmese and Vietnamese in the 1950s; the Malaysians in the ‘60s, and the Lao in the ‘70s. (I’ve been to all of them, and some, more than once.)  So the NMS’s institutional history goes back much further than any of these other museums.<br/><br/>The bad news is that it’s the exact opposite when it comes to the actual histories of the nations themselves.  The Rangoon museum has a large gallery full of Pyu-period Buddhas going back 2,000 years.  The Phnom Penh museum has magnificent Khmer artefacts going back 1,300 years.  The Bangkok museum has a complete Siamese chess set and KL’s has a Perak bronze Bodhisattva, both created while Europe was still in its Dark Ages.  Jakarta has a courtyard packed with stacks of thousand-year-old stone carvings, apparently because they ran out of space inside the building.  Hanoi has fabulous artefacts going back 3,000 years, and even Vientiane has Megalithic standing stones.   Singapore, on the other hand, was an insignificant backwater until 200 years ago.   Don’t expect  thousand-year-old Singaporean bronzes, weapons, tapestries, ceramics, jade necklaces or ivory carvings in the NMS: you’re as likely to find ancient Singaporean ice skates. <br/><br/>For a brief period, 700 years ago, the island may (or may not) have had a modest trading settlement, as “confirmed” by a handful of gold armlets and rings found on Fort Canning Hill, and as romanticized in a book of Malay Annals that are about as historically trustworthy as the tales of Sindbad’s voyages. With a straight face, the Annals’ author assures us that the mighty founder of this long-lost Kingdom of Singapura, Sang Nila Utama, was a direct descendant of Alexander the Great (who lived 1600 years earlier) and that Singapura was finally destroyed after a siege that rivalled that of Troy, when the Javanese attacked it (with an army of 200,000 warriors)!  Though this story is patently preposterous, you can nevertheless find a brand-new government-issued heroic statue of Sang Nila Utama down on Boat Quay near where Sir Stamford Raffles landed, Raffles himself being a direct descendant of King Agamemnon—oops, sorry, check that; I meant to say of Ben and Annie Raffles.  <br/><br/>So we’re left with an absolutely splendid national history museum building, but a history that only goes back 10% or so of the historical time-lines of every other SE Asian country.  The NMS’s curators are up to this challenge, however: they give a tip o’ the hat to the pre-1818 history of the islands, and then realistically focus on the last 200 years.    <br/><br/>The Building: The colonial government opened a grand neo-Palladian museum in 1887, on the tail end of Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee year, and the building’s immense facade resonates with Imperial pomp and pride.  On either end of the facade, pediments bear the United Kingdom’s royal coat of arms, and between them is a grand dome, trumping the Roman model with stained glass all around its base.  Inside, the gleaming white rotunda is spectacular; its Roman arches, half-pillars, and black wrought-iron balustrades make for some obvious photo-ops.  However, the museum’s interior isn’t at all hidebound and Victorian: you’ll walk along stunning 21st century glass-roofed passageways and courtyards, and many of the exhibits themselves employ cutting-edge technology (see Pediment, Rotunda, Balustrade, and 21st Century photos).  <br/><br/>You should find enough interesting exhibits to last you for several hours.  There’s a large room full of fashionable clothing from the 1900s to 1930s, including a formal dress uniform, a white linen tropical suit, flapper dresses, formal gowns, and my favourite: a set of khakis —pith helmet and all—that the famous Singapore-based zoo-collector Frank Buck might have worn when he was off trapping tigers and pythons.  These aren’t re-creations: they were all dug out from old family cedar chests. (see Dress Uniform, Tropical Suit, and Khakis photos).  On the opposite end of the social scale, you can find grim 1890s-era photographs taken inside an opium den (see Opium Den and Opium Den 2 photos: on the first photo the opium den door appears to be bolted and padlocked, never a good sign if you’re a paying customer).  <br/><br/>One artefact might be of particular interest to Americans and older Britons: the Revere Bell.  This bell was cast in Boston by the Revere family, and donated to St Andrews by the daughter of Paul Revere (the silversmith whose “Midnight Ride” precipitated America’s Revolutionary War and Declaration of Independence), with her stipulation that the bell must be rung every night at eight o’clock sharp to alert every sailor in town to immediately finish his grog and re-board his ship (being a proper Bostonian, she was rather puritanical about drunken sailors).  Older Britons will of course immediately realize that (1) having a single church-bell shut down every pub in town simultaneously is much more efficient than expecting every publican in Singapore to be equipped with both a reliable timepiece and a small bell to ring as he calls out “time, gentlemen, time please” and (2) having to close pubs at 8:00 pm is even worse than those aggravating tavern times under the Defence of the Realm Act.  Unfortunately, the Revere Bell had a fatal flaw and is no longer in operation.  Fortunately, the same is true of the Defence of the Realm Act. (See Revere Bell and Bell Inscription photos).<br/><br/>The materials on Singapore during the 1942-1945 Japanese occupation were extremely interesting, bringing home what daily life was like to regular Singaporean citizens.  I particularly admired the Japanese movie poster in English about a blockbuster new movie coming to a Singapore theatre near you, which will use “actual battle footage” to show Singaporeans “how the invincible Imperial Army brought THE FALL OF SINGAPORE.”  This action-packed thriller was produced by the Press Section of the Yamashita Corps itself.  I’d be interested in seeing that film, even though I know how the sequel ends: the Imperial Army turns out to be vincible after all, and Yamashita himself gets hanged for war crimes (though the Manila ones, not the Singapore ones; see the Fall of Singapore Poster photo). <br/><br/>Finally, there are the ten national treasures. Don’t expect Lion Thrones or Jade Buddhas, but NMS is doing the best it can.  One of the treasures is that Javanese gold jewellery.  At the time they were probably buried, the Strait offshore had a serious piracy problem: nearby Bintan Island alone was said to have harboured 300 pirate ships (perhaps another fabulous exaggeration).  No Javanese jewellery is Singapore-made of course, and it might well be buried pirate loot rather than proof of a long-lost trading centre on Singapura Island, but as the only ancient gold horde ever discovered in Singapore, it will have to do. <br/><br/>Of the other national treasures, two stand out in my opinion:  <br/><br/>First, a full-length portrait of Sir Frank Swettenham, done by John Singer Sargent.  It’s a splendid painting, and Swettenham was a remarkable man.  As a national treasure, it would have been equally or even more appropriate for Malaysia’s national museum (which does have an imposing statue of him in front of it).  Swettenham was one of about three dozen governors that Singapore had over 140 years of British rule, and his 4-year term was about par.  However, during his tenure, he pursued a policy of trying to pry away Siam’s tributary states of Kelantan and Trengganu and absorb them into the British Empire.  His immediate success was limited to King Rama the Great reluctantly agreeing to appoint British advisers to these provinces, but the eventual result was to transfer sovereignty of both provinces, as well as Kedah, to the British, and hence to modern Malaysia.  (To the credit of the Thai monarchy, however, Siam was the only Asian coastal nation from the Mediterranean to the South China Sea, that was never under either European rule or European occupation).  Sargent’s heroic portrait shows Swettenham in a dress uniform that is identical to the one mentioned above, but with the addition of the star of St. Michael and St. George, and a dress sword.  If you think Sargent depicts him as a strong-willed man, an uncompromising imperialist, and perhaps a bit of a cad, both you and the artist might be correct. <br/><br/>Second, the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings.   William Farquhar was the military engineer who blew the historic walls of Malacca to smithereens (on strict orders) prior to Malacca’s restoration to the Dutch, though Raffles urged him not to; when the Brits and Dutch then negotiated a treaty under which Britain wound up keeping Malacca after all, Farquhar was the goat, and Raffles got the credit for having been right.  Farquhar spoke Malay fluently and negotiated the treaty that ceded the rights to Singapore to the UK, at which point Raffles sailed in, signed the treaty and got full credit for it.  Farquhar was the Resident who built up Singapore during its first four formative years, at which point Raffles sailed in and promptly dismissed Farquhar.  Farquhar formally complained of his treatment, and the Company directors sided with Raffles.  Raffles and Farquhar both had roads named after them in Singapore; nowadays there’s both a Raffles Blvd and a Raffles Avenue, while Farquhar’s road was obliterated 15 years ago, and no Singapore road now bears his name.  There’s a Raffles Place and a Raffles Hotel; you’ll look in vain for Farquhar counterparts.  There actually still is a Farquhar Terrace on one edge of Fort Canning Hill; I never sit downhill from it, expecting the freak landslide any day now.  Every time they interacted, Raffles wound up coming out on top, and Farquhar on the bottom.   Both men were avid naturalists; the largest flower on Earth is named after Raffles; Farquhar never even got a weed named after him.  Both men commissioned drawings of flora and fauna.  Farquhar’s collection of natural history drawings wasn’t bad, not bad at all; but Raffles’ collection was bigger and better and also included Java, so he even came out on top for natural history drawing collections.  Sir Stamford Raffles then sailed back home to high honours in England.  But hold on; what’s this?  Before arriving back in Blighty, Raffles’ ship caught fire and his collection of natural history drawings went up in flames, leaving only Farquhar’s as a unique collection dating from the birth of Singapore.  A great loss to the field of natural history, of course, much to be regretted; but finally, FINALLY something worked out with Farquhar on top of Raffles!  The Chinese artists Farquhar used were quite good, and the drawings, like those of Audubon, are works of art.  Of all ten national treasures, this is the one you’ll probably spend the most time looking at.  You could actually spend more time on these beautiful drawings, than the other nine treasures combined.<br/><br/>I’m giving the National Museum of Singapore 4 stars, which might not be fair, but if I rated it 5, that would mean that I think it’s as worthwhile as the Singapore Zoo, the Southern Ridges, the Botanical Gardens, Sultan Mosque, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Gardens by the Bay, and Clarke Quay (I could add more).  My instinct is that if you’re spending two weeks or so as a tourist in Singapore, you should by all means visit the NMS.  But if you’re only here for a week or less, the NMS should be lower down on your agenda, particularly if this is your first visit to Asia, because then Kampong Glam, Chinatown, Little India, and the Museum of Asian Civilizations might all be more worthwhile and memorable.  I do think the NMS is the best curated and most innovative national history museum in SE Asia; architecturally the museum is second only to Bangkok’s.  But its collection cannot compete against those other countries, each with a rich and long history.  Even some smaller museums, such as the Cham Sculpture Museum in Da Nang, beat the NMS on that score.  So: Very Good, yes; but Essential, no."

Aryan2007,"19,169",Feb-19,Dec-18,50,Best place to learn about the History of Singapore !!!,The National Museum of Singapore is the oldest museum in Singapore. It was basically started as a section of a library at Singapore Institution called the Raffles Library and Museum way back in 1849. It was relocated on several occasions and finally in 1887 it moved to its permanent present site on Stamford Road.<br/><br/>The museum has many exhibits related to the history of Singapore. It is one of 4 national museums in the country. It was named the National Museum of Singapore in 1965. It was known as the Singapore History Museum for few years.<br/><br/>It is a nice place to have a peaceful experience and know in detail about this country. Entry fee i nominal and is recommended for visit especially if you have kids travelling with you to enrich their knowledge.

Rorypatrick,82,Jan-19,Jan-19,40,Very worthwhile,If you are a history fan or if you just want a break from the Singapore hustle &amp; bustle then <br/>the National Museum of Singapore is well worth a visit.

Darthhalo,37,Jan-19,Jan-19,50,It has more than you expect,"You can spend at least 3 hours here. Learn about the history of Singapore and experience an amazing immersive multimedia experience called the ""Story of the Forest"". It was mesmerizing! Saw lots of people just lying down and looking really relaxed! Best enjoyed when less people are there. Recommend going late before closing like 4pm and see this installation at 6pm. You might get the whole space to yourself! Terribly romantic if you intend to propose to your other half too! (I think! Since I am already married 😅)"

kpiddy,"10,792",Jan-19,Dec-18,50,Stunning architecture as well as lovely and cool inside.,"Our only problem was that we ran out of time for a more comprehensive visit to the museum as planned, instead of forgoing a visit we decided to explore as much of the musuem as possible for free as our time permitted and enjoy the air-conditioning. <br/> <br/>From the outside the building is beautiful with its large prominent dome, all painted white and grey, the front part of the building was built in 1887 in European style, once inside the foyer near the ticket office, some of its features reminded me of the San Francisco City Hall on a smaller scale.<br/><br/>The ticket office kindly informed us that there was a free exhibition on the lower ground which we could visit, 'Italy: The beauty of knowledge'.  We thoroughly enjoyed this exhibition spending forty minutes or so before heading up to the museum's bookstore located next to the museum's cafe.  My advice is to allow at least two to three hours or more to visit this beautiful organised musuem and its architecture, both old and new."

drtgfnz,749,Jan-19,Jan-19,50,Excellent ,Well laid out. Great visuals and commentaries. Informative look at this country’s history. Excellent resource. Take your time to look at all the galleries and listen to the oral histories. Allow 3 hours. Closes at 7pm so a great late afternoon experience.

Finda Ayu,204,Dec-18,Nov-18,40,Enjoyable Museum!,"Love the museum at the first sight, the architecture is nice. Love the details they have inside and outside the building. They have free area to visit and somekind of gallery that you need to buy tickets. I regret I didn’t buy one though. The free area has few rooms of singapore important phase of history. Each room has different ambient and amazing details to enjoy. Their interior is great for taking pics! And they have little souvenir corner enough for you to buy some unique souvenirs. My favourite part is their multimedia room that shows typical singapore village in a super wide screen. They have bean bags in this room so you can just lay down, enjoy the ac and rest your feet after walking around. Enjoyable!"

ZestfulLiving,181,Dec-18,Dec-18,50,Worthy of a Visit,"The National Gallery was excellent to visit, but it's difficult (and not advised) to rush through.  The design of the building, alone, and the history of the buildings is very interesting and well documented and explained at one of the exhibits.  I loved my time at this place.  The restaurant on the upper deck was also very good."

Graham H,184,Dec-18,Nov-18,40,Worth a Visit,"Interesting way to find about the history of Singapore. Well laid out and very informative.<br/>Perfect place to spend 2 or 3 hours, especially if it's raining."

Jeff A,34,Dec-18,Dec-18,50,The Making of Singapore,"This museum displays a chronicle of Singapore that is very intriguing, you are taken through the museum from the birth of Singapore to present day, many displays have audio commentary which is very helpful, small entry fee applies.."
,,,,,,
Greg S,20,Dec-18,Nov-18,50,Excellent Displays,"The museum is in the heart of the town, a short walk from most major hotels.  The building is very nice and fittingly historic.  There are several very interesting electronic displays over many levels inside and these are great for kids especially.  They are a very unique way to showcase the island wildlife.  The old Singapore displays are interesting, as are the items from the opium trade era.  The WW2 displays featuring a Japanese tank are very interesting and unique as well.  Overall an excellent way to spend a few hours."
,,,,,,
Lau KS,11,Dec-18,Nov-18,30,Not as great as before,"I visited the museum some years ago and recently returned to find that it has been somewhat renovated. When I visited 7 years ago , there was an excellent multi-layered presentation with information from scholars to short description on objects presented via an electronic gadget and visitors could choose from a personal or official path to learn about Singapore's history. It appears that  some sections have been removed, and there is no e-device that offers more depth info for self tours. The history gallery has adopted a more parochial look and the galleries on the upper levels are simplistic and generally poorly designed with the exception of the Modern gallery which was quite charming."
,,,,,,
King Louis S,508,Dec-18,Dec-18,50,Excellent,I visited this museum today and was very impressed. I arrived at 11am in time for a tour which just made the place come alive. My guide was originally from Holland and had been living in Singapore for 8 years - she was excellent. Knowledgeable and entertaining and kept the pace moving. I really do recommend this event. The galleries are so informative and interactive nothing old or static about this place. The cafe was excellent too. Highly recommended.

Catherinegagnon,88,Dec-18,Dec-18,50,Not only for history freaks,"History comes in many forms and this museum certainly provides you with choices.  Reconstructions of rooms, interactive exhibits, political speeches presentations, explanations of cultural differences, all contribute to a better understanding of the history of Singapore.  A must."

Denise B,43,Dec-18,Nov-18,50,A MUST visit!,"Anyone interested in understanding the history of Singapore should start with the National Museum of Singapore;  from there explore Chinatown, the Hindu and Malay districts, the Arab quarter, and then the Anglo/European parts, including the Battlebox.  Singapore is about so much more than the shopping!   We spent 4 hours at the museum, and could have stayed longer.  Note it has two very nice restaurants for lunch!"

lilkitty111,211,Dec-18,Apr-18,50,"Interactive, Informative, Interesting Exhibits","On a rainy day in Singapore we took shelter inside the National Museum. Upon entering I had no knowledge about the history of Singapore and the turmoils they faced during World War II (I am not into History). However after exploring for a few hours I was enlightened. The interactive, visually appealing, informative exhibits made me clearly aware of their History. There is so much to see and learn from fashion and toys, daily life and traditions, the island's development and extracts from WWII. You can even have a whiff of different sought-out plants in one gallery. I really enjoyed the interactivity. The Glass Rotunda was an amazing sight. The beautiful, majestic images on large, clear pictured screens was mesmerising. At the bottom in the enclosed room we laid down on the ground and watched the floor to ceiling pictures for about 20 minutes as they changed and evolved. It was relaxing and pleasing."

BigSur707,274,Dec-18,Nov-18,40,Nice museum on the history of Singapore,"Good exhibits retracing the history of Singapore, from ancient times to today.  Well laid out, lots of interesting items.  In an old Colonial era building, but entirely renovated with a modern annex at the back.  Great aircon: was nice to get away from the heat outside for a couple of hours!  Next to Fort Canning Park, which is worth a look as well"

Set aside a couple of hours to your iteneary here in Singapore. Fort canning hill, situated just behind it is good to go too to get an in depth of Singapore's history."

InspiredReviewer,972,Nov-18,Nov-18,50,Outstanding ,This museum presents the history of Singapore back through the century rise but for me the WWI and II exhibition is poinient and well done. The glass rotunda is s complete contrast which presents everything to do with forrest’s in a unique way - so enchanting. <br/>Definitely a must see - so enjoyable.

airheart_ash,147,Nov-18,Nov-18,40,Fascinating history,"I think Singapore has the most unique history of the last 50 years of all of the 40 countries I have visited. I wanted to learn how it had become a super power so quickly. I felt I could have learned more here, however, it was just enough information without overload and sore feet. The museum has whet my appetite to learn more about his extraordinary country. Having come to this museum, I am proud to have chosen to visit Singapore as a tourist, having been here for business and stopovers a few times. I thoroughly receommend."

debasis d,29,Nov-18,Nov-18,30,Museum not a benchmark,This particular one charges $15 per ticket unlike other museums in Europe which are mostly free! The inside is not so great as their history is also not that old and colourful!! End of the day not worth it .
,,,,,,
occasional_typo,213,Nov-18,Nov-18,50,Marvellous,"During the heat of the day this place provides a welcome respite.<br/>I thought it was an incredibly, informative and engaging interactive journey through the history of Singapore.<br/>The standout for me was the beautiful, immersive 'story of the forest' by Team Lab.  <br/>I could have lay on the floor of the space for hours it was so beautiful.<br/>I noted the YMCA is right next door. I believe the current building stands on the site of the old YMCA which was an interrogation and torture site during the Japanese occupation of WWII.<br/>Thought provoking stuff"

Shaikidon,308,Nov-18,Nov-18,20,reworked but still not going thru,as few years ago the place was closed and we had time in this visit - we tried.<br/>not to the point - nice as children place - not serious for adults that want real facts and not a simple (very simple) presentation.<br/>I wanted to see more of the life and got general stories and some pictures...<br/>unless you are with children - not a requirement in any visit to Singapore

Adele C,45,Nov-18,Nov-18,50,Fascinating place.,So glad we visited this fascinating place....very close to our hotel so thought it would be somewhere nice and clean and cool to visit and it certainly was that.

JKPImageFusion,505,Nov-18,Nov-18,50,Excellent Innovative Museum,Very well designed modern museum with immersive exhibits.

Paul H,"1,746",Nov-18,Aug-18,50,We sent hours here,"Every country I've been too have a museum . This one is so good as it's not a general museum but it tells the story of Singapore. Anyone British should be proud of Singapore. They are members of the commonwealth. Their soldiers fought in the first and Second World War side by side with the U.K. Singapore love the queen and most speak English. <br/>I found out that business's are often linked to UK companies such as Dysons. The building is Victorian and well worth looking around for the building alone. Coin, invaders, discoverers all feature. Wonderful paintings and displays. I think it's an unmissable site do visit."

Kate A,32,Nov-18,Nov-18,50,Outstanding!,"An interactive, full senses immersion exploration of the history of Singapore. From the 1200s onwards. Beautifully laid out and chock full of relevant artifacts and objects. We did not need a guide or tour, but were perfectly fine pottering along at our own pace. <br/><br/>My teen son loved this more than all the other activities we've done this trip. <br/><br/>Gorgeous merger of colonial and modern architecture to boot. <br/><br/>A hearty thanks to Givaudan for teaming up with the museum to provide olfactory delights along the way. More of this in museums and galleries across the globe, please!"

wendy lyons-beck,168,Nov-18,Nov-18,50,Take your time ,We spent 2 hours here without stopping for coffee. The history and explanations as well as the hi-tech visuals really intrigued us.We were lucky enough to hear the last few minutes of a tour that helped us understand the most current reality of Singapore. We highly recommend visiting this museum.Singapore is so much more than shopping and the extravagant parks and buildings.
,,,,,,
Brian M,"1,538",Oct-18,Oct-18,50,Wonderful museum,What an incredible museum! This is definitely a must see attraction. The glass rotunda is amazing.

Juliet,7,Oct-18,Oct-18,50,Great way to spend a few hours in Singapore,The National Museum was one of the stops on our hop on/  hop off  bus tour  and turned out to be  one of the highlights of our visit to Singapore.   We were lucky enough to arrive just in time to join the English  Speaking Tour.  it was so informative and provided the historical overview  of Singapore I had been  looking for.  Entrance to the Museum is a tad expensive but worth it to learn about such an interesting history and to gain an insight into Singaporean life.
,,,,,,
A L,70,Oct-18,Oct-18,40,Great for an historical overview.,"Visited on first day, was great to gain a historical overview before starting our tours. Couple of hours is adequate. We then walked through the rear exit into Canning park, walked to Clarke’s quay via the spice garden etc."

snowprincejuneau,14,Oct-18,Oct-18,50,Unexpected Major Highlight,"Visited The National Museum earlier this week during a business/pleasure trip to Singapore. Thought this would be a nice way to kill a couple of hours in between a meeting and evening activities! Caught the 4 PM English speaking tour performed by a volunteer of the museum. We started out with 8 people in the group but 1 hour and 20 minutes later by the end of the tour it seemed like it expanded to around 40. It was done by a retired native Singaporean who lived through a lot of the history and he brought it all to life! Such a special memory, one of the highlights of our remarkable stay in Singapore all for the price of admission!"

Dan L,"3,451",Oct-18,Oct-18,50,Cultural and Architectural landmark,"This Museum gives the visitor a very good overview of Singapore history with static displays and images and video montages of everyday life. On Level 1, The History Gallery  showcases the development of the country from early beginnings 700 years ago through the colonial period, the Japanese Occupation, Independence and the establishment of the modern City. On Level 2, take a walk through the past 100 years for a more detailed understanding of e City's history to the present day. The Goh Seng Choo Gallery explores the world of magic and beliefs as practised  by traditional SE Asian societies. Take the lift to the top of the Rotunda and as you descend the walkway, enjoy the digital displays and photograph exhibition. <br/>Take time to enjoy the architecture of this beautiful building and the dome that sits at the front of the building. Wonderful place to immerse yourself for 3 - 4 hours or more."

Barry G,139,Oct-18,Oct-18,50,Impressed ,"I took the MRT and alighted at Shiny Ghaur station. Exit A and and a right turn and you are there with a 5 minute walk. Nice juxtaposition of old renaissance and modern architecture on display. The rich tapestry of Singapore's history is authenticity captured in the displays. Worth the visit to learn more about the 'little red dot. The 2nd World War section was emotional with the best and worst of mankind there to see. Apart from a very unpleasant odour in this particular area,  the whole thing was faultless. I suggest tagging along with one of the guided tours as you will certainly learn more that way. There is English and Chinese speaking tours. There is also good coffee in the cafe with its nice peaceful setting on the ground floor. There is also a 60+ discount if you have reached that age milestone,  which I have recently done!"

Jhud69,76,Oct-18,Oct-18,50,Superb Historical Museum Providing A Great Insights on Singapore's History and Culture.,"A lovely Museum housed in a historical building which has been renovated like most museums with a modern fusion. The exhibitions are well designed and easy to follow.  They provide a comprehensive overview of Singapore's history and culture.  Guided tours are available but not necessary as all information is in English. The displays of Antiques and Vintage items is fascinating as well. Currently the Story of the Forrest is been exhibited, entry is from Level 2, Glass Rotunda. This digital art is stunning as it takes you down to other levels and exhibits. The Eateries are also a pleasant way to relax before or after viewing."

saskia h,62,Oct-18,Oct-18,40,Interesting - both for locals and visitors,"This is a lovely museum in which there is so much to see. It's got a lovely 'walk through the ages' type of exposition about Singapore. So much to learn and see and all very nicely done.<br/>Once you have purchased tickets, you can choose to be taken round by a guide (free of charge- they are all highly trained volunteers), or stroll around by yourself, at your own pace. <br/>A great place for all ages.<br/>There is a cafe inside which sells delicious cakes - but if you walk round the corner there is a Janice Wong cafe for chocolate lovers (also very tasty lunch menu!)."
,,,,,,
Annie C,56,Oct-18,Mar-18,50,Impressionist Art Exhibitions,"Thumbs up for guided tour by advance registration on the same day/ audio-aid tour/ on your own at your own pace tour. Besides emotion and thought-evoking paintings, it provides history on the resilient spirit of impressionist artists to overcome conventions and constraints to add colours to their otherwise black and white arts, thanks to new colours invented by Scientisrs. I am very gratified to be able to appreciate my long-beloved impressionist art here in my homeland, and would b very glad to share it with locals as well as tourists. I hope such exhibitions would recur for more viewing opportunities."

The second floor had q photography exhibit from around the world showing many of the problems. It was riveting.<br/>Also starting on the second floor was a graphic display of the history of a forest. It was artistically beautiful with music. You go through it on a pathway that circles around the room gradually taking you lower, It was very worthwhile and child friendly."

Piglet47,272,Oct-18,Oct-18,50,What an amazing museum!,"As the weather was not looking too promising we decided to forego another visit to the Botanic Gardens and go to the National Museum. Dare I say I was glad the weather was uncertain? This museum is really worth a visit, rain or shine! <br/>The displays are very well set out and the information boards are clear and interesting to read. The history of Singapore is far more complex than I thought and so it was also a very educational trip. We didn't coincide with the guided tours which are currently held at 11.00 and 14.00 but this meant we could wander round at our own pace. It took us over three hours! An excellent introduction into the varied past which has made Singapore what it is today."

Donsafe,"1,031",Oct-18,Feb-18,40,Great Historical Window Into Old Singapore,"I was born in Singapore in 1958, the son of a British Royal Airforce Engineer. I went to school here until I was 11. It was a very different place then and I loved it. Back in Europe I never forgot it or stopped longing for it.  Although I am proud of what Singapore has achieved and that it is a more modern and successful place now, I miss the old kampong-style city. This museum brought the old Singapore back to me for a day. I am very grateful and will come back next time I visit the city."

Mazmannan,"9,063",Oct-18,Apr-18,50,Excellent all round,"The National Museum Of Singapore is a must see place for all visitors to Singapore.<br/><br/>The museum is housed in a beautiful building - and reminds you of the colonial splendor of British architecture.. It is the oldest museum in Singapore and dates back to 1887.<br/><br/>It is open daily from 10am to 7pm - and the last admission is at 6.15pm. I enjoyed the Story of the Forest. It was a clever technological display that has to be seen to be believed - as it transforms drawings into 3D animation.<br/><br/>There are other exhibitions about Singapore's past - the Japanese occupation was interesting.<br/><br/>Every last Saturday of the month - there are ""family time"" activities.<br/><br/>I spent half a day in this museum - and still felt that i could go round again.<br/><br/>Admission is free to Singapore citizens and permanent residents."

bsyoung43,7,Oct-18,Sep-18,50,History personified.,"Magnificent building, so much to see and do, please do not miss this one, absolutely brilliant. The architecture itself is well worth the visit, the history, particularly the history of the war years we found most interesting."

Shihoko,344,Sep-18,Sep-18,50,Great collection of artwork in a stunning space,"The museum is an impressive building housing a great collection of artwork. It is a great place to understand Singapore's history, as well as experiencing modern works. My favourite areas were ""Art of the Rehearsal"", an immersive video installation that has dancers perform across a panoramic view, and ""Story of the Forest"" which is a digital presentation, that can only be described as magical - at floor level, take the time to lie facing up and watch as you are transported elsewhere.

Nicky7030,345,Sep-18,Sep-18,50,Great for understanding the history of Singapore.,"I traveled with my sister to Singapore, the museum was our first stop because we wanted to know a bit more about the history of Singapore and this museum really helped.  It's spacious, informative and interesting.  There are some amazing animated displays that you lie back on beanbags to enjoy.  <br/>The Banyan tree outside the museum was probably the highlight of my visit, I've never seen one before and was fascinated by it.<br/>There is a cafe inside the museum and the food was very good."

Paul_Guo,7,Sep-18,Sep-18,40,History of Singapore,It's always good to know the history of a country when visiting their countries. The museum itself is very well located and we loved the area. The museum is very spacious and great technologies to introduce us the history of Singapore. Singapore did a great job preserving the original form of the architecture. Great sunlight entering through the glass windows.

SteveM999,314,Sep-18,Sep-18,50,Fantastic museum,"Wonderful few hours in here with a great guided tour, passionate about Singapore. Really informative displays on a variety of aspects of the history of Singapore. Really brought it's modern history to life."

Jan215,119,Sep-18,Aug-18,50,Excellent museum,"We had a guided tour to start with, at 11am, this was very informative and very interesting, about the origins and history of Singapore.  Lunch was very nice there. The planetarium is a must see with (digital) flowers falling down the walls (you are on a bridge to start) and then you walk down the walkway to the lower level (and on the left hand side it has a projection of a forest turning from day into night)  this is just incredible, and then you end up on the lower level watching the flowers again falling from the ceiling down the walls and seemingly the flowers and forest are all around you - just delightful.  A great day out, a small fee to get in but well worth it."

Kingsley M,5,Sep-18,Sep-18,40,Its good to see the progress,I enjoyed an extremely good tour at 11am by a very well informed volunteer guide on Sep 20 ( sorry i cannot recall her name) . It was great to see the early Singapore and the great advances that have been made today.<br/><br/>If only i could drag every Australian MP through it so they see what can be done when the politicians pull their fingers out!!

ianshamshey,902,Sep-18,Sep-18,40,make the time to visit!,"It is the oldest museum [in a beautiful building] and a cultural landmark telling the story of Singapore to the world. It is divided into three levels-Level One-the Singapore History Gallery, Level 2- Life in Singapore over the past 100 years [very interesting] dealing with the Modern Colony,  the Japanese occupation and the Growing up Gallery-echoing the sentiments of a generation. Level 3-activity space. There is a gift shop and three eating venues-Food for Thought-adjacent to the gift shop-good for coffee and a quick snack. There is also Flutes and Janice Wong Singapore-the latter showcasing chocolates for dining as well as retail. Make the time for this-easily accessible via the MRT [subway line]"

112358-12,111,Sep-18,Sep-18,20,"Pleasant building, but...","The best historical exhibition in Singapore is the Art Gallery (in the refurbished Court House, overlooking the historical Cricket ground).  Great collection, wonderful architecture.  The second best is the Asian Civilizations Museum, just down the road from it.  The National Museum is a distant third.  The main display is pedestrian, while the digital display (Rain forest) is childish, and I don't mean that as a compliment.  Even the inept ArtSceince Museum is moderately engaging by comparison.  Unless you have may days to spare, or are looking for a wedding shoot location, I would put this place well down the list."

Joanne R,46,Sep-18,Sep-18,50,Beautiful museum.,Beautifully curated museum. Not too big but still full of great history. Easy to move through. Good snap shot of Dingapore.

travellingdragon2018,37,Sep-18,Sep-18,40,Interesting museum to fill in time,"This museum is set in a beautiful building. It is very different to normal national museums, having very few artifacts to see. <br/>It was more a story of the last 200 yrs ( very little information about the island’s history before the English arrived. )<br/>The special exhibition re flowers and the forest was rather strange. <br/>The guide who did the 2 pm English tour yesto(?Michelle) was wonderful. <br/>Entry was discounted for seniors at $10. <br/>If you are short of time in Singapore give this museum a miss."

lynn s,89,Sep-18,Sep-18,50,A must visit.,Very interesting way to spend a few hours. Very well laid out and incredibly informative about Singapore history. Extremely clean and really nice friendly staff. Very nice coffee shop too.
,,,,,,
Erin D,1,Sep-18,Sep-18,50,Blown away,"This museum was excellently curated. It painted an engaging and comprehensive portrait of Singapore's history, from its roots as a trade economy, to its history as a British colony, to an independent nation. The information was easy to follow, and the exhibits were varied and interesting. Particularly touching was a section about the Japanese occupation and a film documenting Lee Kuan Yew's speech regarding Singapore's separation from Malaysia. I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to Singaporean history!"

nemesisvv,"2,106",Sep-18,Sep-18,30,A good day off,"Its a great place to have a day off the busy city life and slow down to enjoy the various exhibits. These changes from time to time and when I was there, it had several gallery showing the history of Singapore through the 19 - 20 century. It was pretty interesting."
,,,,,,
Marshall S,470,Sep-18,Sep-18,50,Great view of the history of this incredible Island state,I visited this museum as many other art museums were either closed for renovation or closed for good.  I found the exhibitions of the history of Singapore very interesting to learn how much Singapore has advanced since formation .

WinnoGuru,22,Sep-18,Sep-18,50,Bloody ripper!,"I don’t write many reviews but this place is an absolute highlight for the history enjoying wine drinking, food enjoyer! Sensational! Don’t miss, tour is terrific and Flutes restaurant is absobloodylutely fantastic! House wines to die for at the price (particularly the Prosecco). Chilli crab pasta excellent. Not a budget buster either. Team members are excellent too! Is that a rave review, is it what!"

dineindulge,77,Sep-18,Jan-18,50,Very enjoyable visit,We very much enjoyed our visit to this museum.  It is located in a beautifully renovated building.  The exhibits are quite diverse and interesting.  A mix of Asian and European art.  Friendly staff are available to answer all questions and offer advice.
,,,,,,
GeneralShamu,535,Sep-18,Aug-18,50,Excellent Museum &amp; All Encompassing,Surprised to see this is not ranked higher on the top things to do list in Singapore. Thought the museum was excellent as it took you from ancient to modern times of life in Singapore and the Straits Settlements.
,,,,,,
Sarah K,38,Sep-18,Aug-18,40,A surprising favorite,"This was my favorite activity during our one day stay in Singapore. It was fascinating to learn the history of the country. There is a good mix of things to look at, videos to watch, recordings to listen to, and signs to read. However, there not less detail about the years after the country was established, which I would have been interested in learning about. The cafe there is wonderful."
,,,,,,
Chris S,950,Sep-18,Sep-18,50,Lovely museum,"We were too early to go for the Battlebox tour so having reserved for 1.30 ,came here to pass a few hours, and so glad we did. The space is beautiful and it’s a really good presentation of the history of Singapore. We had lunch on the terrace and wished we had had more time for the restaurant. A very relaxing morning."
,,,,,,
Dave K,6,Sep-18,Sep-18,10,Visitors Not Welcome after 6:00,"I went to visit the museum and arrived at 6:05.  I was informed that after 6:00, only Singapore residents are allowed in (for free).  I graciously offered to pay, but they hid behind policy and refused to let me in.  Open until 7:00???"
,,,,,,
Lorraine B,244,Aug-18,Aug-18,50,Good presentation of the history of Singapore,"One highlight of this Museum is a corkscrew walk downwards with murals on the wall depicting the animals and plants which would have been found in Singapore before it became so populated. This would be very popular with children. There was an interesting photography display in the Museum showing people who had accidentally become part of photographs of famous events, even though they themselves were not the principal characters of the event. I found this concept very interesting."
,,,,,,
Tuyet Mai,15,Aug-18,Aug-18,40,Meaningfull,"This museum is very attractive. Staffs are polite. We love to explore however not too much areas/ information, just need around 2 hours to visit."

Nancy P,477,Aug-18,Apr-18,50,First-rate,"Geared towards both adults and children, this museum is well done. It is located in a beautiful building at a convenient location near MRT stations.  There is a nice variety of exhibits.  They should provide benches for weary tourists."
,,,,,,
Deepa P,79,Aug-18,Aug-18,50,So glad we didn’t miss this ,"We didn’t have time to do this museum justice but we really enjoyed seeing the very well curated history of Singapore gallery. I think it’s an essential part of a visit to Singapore. A bit pricey, especially the restaurant."

,,,,,,
Edward Cook,350,Aug-18,Aug-18,50,A lot of new knowledge,I did not know a lot about the history of Singapore over the last 100 years but after visiting the museum I am overflowing with knowledge. The integration of a lot of technology into the museum means it is very up to date and more enjoyable for some younger visitors too.
,,,,,,
DJandR,399,Aug-18,Aug-18,50,Amazing,"The story of the forest is a fantastic installation, comprising of 69 animations shown over three levels in the rotunda, we went for the history of Singapore but this was a very pleasant addition. The local history is really well displayed broken up into four different galleries. A very busy museum but plenty of amenities for everyone. If you want to walk through Fort Canning exit on level three rather than try to negotiate it from the front of the museum."

brianhkt,2,Aug-18,Aug-18,50,Digital,Had a good time seeing how the conventional media can be given a new lease of life by integrating it with digital media. Made it more interesting and meaningful.

Toby S.,108,Aug-18,Aug-18,50,Top Museum with Two Standout Galleries,"This really is a great museum. Cleverly laid out with well presented exhibits. Contrary to some other peoples comments most of it is actually not free (unless you happen to be Singaporean) but costs S$15. As a result of the need to pay the ticket desk is a bottle neck. There will be queues most afternoons to get in.<br/><br/>If you're pushed for time, and I realise what follows is subjective, there were two standout galleries for me. Start by going up the escalator and into the ""Story of the Forest"" exhibit. Nothing to do with Singapore it's a moving light show that feels like you're walking through a kids picture book. Really well done. And you eventually end up at the start of...<br/><br/>...The story of Singapore Gallery. The main purpose of the museum this takes you through Singapore's history in multi-media exhibits that you can spend as long or as short a time with depending on how much detail you're after.<br/><br/>Finally, as an alternative to the pricey museum cafe, the university just over the street has a couple of excellent food courts. I'd particularly recommend ""The Tea Party Express"" at street level for dirt cheap, alfresco pasta dishes in a box often with a free drink."
,,,,,,
CalP7,84,Aug-18,Apr-18,50,Worth a Visit,"We spent over half a day at this museum, it is well worth a visit.  We took the train to the National Museum and it was an easy 300-400m walk to the museum, easy to find. Lovely old building. Has a coffee shop inside. Afterwards you can walk down to Orchard Rd which isn't a long walk or go to Orchard Rd on the train, only a couple of stops. If you like museums this place is worth a visit."

There are some interesting exhibits on the upper floors as well. The building’s architecture is also pleasing to view."

KGB777,"38,159",Aug-18,Aug-18,40,Back to the National Museum,We returned to the National Museum recently for another visit. Being free for citizens and PRs it makes for a useful attraction on rainy days. The kids are usually quite happy to wander through the exhibits for an hour or so.
,,,,,,
Merv C,97,Aug-18,May-18,50,What a surprise this was,"The Museum was very well presented and follows the photographic history, war and urban development throughout the decades. We were able to visually see the changes we vaguely remembered over our trips to Singapore 24 years ago, 12 years ago and now. The 360 degree electronical optical display on the way out was great,"

Aaron F,3,Aug-18,Jul-18,50,Very Educational,"This museum is one of the few museums I enjoy visiting. Not only the exhibitions (both permanent and temporary) organized very well but also provided educational-purpose to the visitors. I would recommend first time traveler to the Singapore making this museum a must-go. Also, don’t forget to download the “National Museum of Singapore” from the App Store. The app offers translation in different languages for the foreigners who does not speak English as their main language. Very useful and the app is free to download."
,,,,,,
Le petit chat noir,121,Aug-18,Jul-18,30,For history buffs,This museum has some excellent exhibits detailing the historical and cultural development of Singapore. If that's what you're into you will enjoy this museum. For our money the Asian Civilizations Museum was a much preferable experience.
,,,,,,
Mr&MrsWilko,427,Aug-18,Jul-18,50,Interesting history and beautiful building,"We thought that this was a very good museum.  An excellent way to obtain a good summary history of Singapore.  The exhibits are interesting and provide a balanced view of what has sometimes been a turbulent past.  The upstairs galleries provide good example and insight to more recent history.<br/><br/>The building itself is beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, a good museum, worth the entry fee and a good start to anyone visiting Singapore for the first time."

JoeA3,145,Jul-18,Jul-18,50,Interesting,It is a nice interesting building and a fun place to explore. Seems to have more stuff about Singapores development and recent history rather than cabinets full of artifacts.

DavidNAustralia,113,Jul-18,Jul-18,30,Interesting,"This is a highly rated attraction and relatively new. I wonder why many modern museums are so gloomy which among other things makes it difficult to read the explanations of the exhibits, It certainly provides plenty of information about the history of Singapore so would be a good starting point for the first time visitor."

,,,,,,
soursops,95,Jul-18,Jul-18,40,"Not cheap, but worth it","At S$15 admission ticket for non-citizens, it is quite steep but worth the visit. Everything was labelled with detailed description. The timeline can get confusing as there's no clear path provided especially at the beginning of the history exhibition (but it does get more linear by the mid section). Very informative, the gems that I found are the 'Malay for Mems' book on display and the 'Stop at two' policy by the Singaporean government to control the population."

HolaArvada,48,Jul-18,Jun-18,50,Unique museum experience,I spent a   lovely afternoon at  this history museum.  Be sure to take one of the complimentary guided tours. The tour lasted an hour and the guide was knowledgeable and interesting.  After the tour I explored on my own.  The museum is easy to navigate. There is a restaurant and gift shop within the building.
,,,,,,
Kathy M,39,Jul-18,Jun-18,50,A very easy museum to navigate and learn,"I went to this on my first full day in Singapore.  What a treasure.  A very easy way to learn about the area you are visiting.  It flows through the years so easily the way it is layed out.  For $10 or $15, a great half of a day.  Lots for little ones when I was there also."

vasavapr,589,Jul-18,Jun-18,50,Informative and Educational,"The museum houses several exhibitions depicting the history of Singapore spanning over 100 years. The exhibitions includes history of times when Singapore was part of Malaysia and just a fishing village, arrival of British traders, evolution of Singapore as a strategic trade hub, Japanese occupation, struggle for independence and the modern times when Singapore gained its own identity. Some exhibits also includes details of how different cultures such as Indian and Chinese flourished in the city. The exhibits and visuals will certainly take you back in time and you will not just know but experience the history of Singapore.<br/><br/>Besides the history of Singapore there was also a very interesting exhibition about old trees in Singapore (not sure if that was a permanent exhibition). Also there is a digital art installation titled ""Story of The Forest"". One can notice glimpse of the Singapore Zoo,  Garden by the Bay and Botanical Gardens (or it could just be me). And lastly there is Wings of Maneuvre which is kinetic chandeliers which sway in some rhythm.<br/><br/>This is the best place not just to know but experience the history of Singapore. A must visit place in Singapore. It is recommended to get the museum app on your phone to get more updated information."

billyhockey,69,Jul-18,Jul-18,50,Singapore History Gallery worth visiting,"We like visiting museums when we travel and, accordingly, we visited the National Museum of Singapore on our trip to the country. Upon arriving at the museum, we decided to view the exhibit called the ""Singapore History Gallery."" We entered the exhibit and were introduced to the history of Singapore, commencing in detail around the 14th century. We then moved into another room, and then another, and then another, and so on. We did not expect the exhibit to be so elaborate and detailed. The exhibit is so enthralling that we spent 2-3 hours in it, slowly and enjoyably learning as we made our way through the history of the country to rooms ultimately featuring information and objects pertaining to contemporary Singapore. It came as a pleasant surprise to us as we gradually realized that we were experiencing an exhibit that is among the best that we have visited. The curators of the exhibit earned our admiration for the skill with which it was designed and carried out."
,,,,,,
AshK1ng,15,Jul-18,Jul-18,50,Beautiful building with excellent history of Singapore,"The museum is separated into many different zones to showcase different eras of Singapore's fascinating history.

Udrasena D,87,Jul-18,May-18,50,Modern Museum,The design layout of the museum reflected the success of Singapore shaping its country.

Christo M,202,Jun-18,Jun-18,40,Good experience ,Efficient from buying a ticket to exit. The museum is very informative and tells the story of Singapore in detail. You can easily spend 2 or more hours there. I also visited the art exhibition and find that great with visitors voting for the best piece of art. Thumbs up for Singaporeans for what they have achieved in a short period of time.

Stories and relics from Singapore's beginnings as a trading center through its period of English colonization, on to its occupation by the Japanese in WW II, its subsequent liberation and independence. Singapore is unique in many ways!"

Huang Wzhong,481,Jun-18,Apr-18,50,"Great museum, great motivation","it's quite unbelievable that a small island country without long historical narrative stories backing up as Singapore will be able to have the great interesting museum.<br/> <br/>this national museum has some unique characteristic and it's so powerful to present the Singaporean historical stories in another specific aspect to make Singaporean to proud of their multi-cultural nation collaboration. <br/><br/>almost of the galleries has planned perfectly and well organized with a lot of interactive learning supporting media.<br/><br/>from my personal, I have the most favorite gallery that's so impressive, there has mentioned about the lover who had survived and painful suffering living during Japanese occupation period,<br/><br/>I couldn't remember exactly narrative wording from a video, but roughly ""..it's quite difficult to understand how can the people still loved during the brutality uncertain consequence like that, but on the other hand the people might asked during the brutality uncertain circumstance like that how can we live without love...""<br/><br/>this is the right place to get comprehensive understanding about Singapore, and learn the dynamical key to build up the prosperity country.<br/><br/>there is no doubt, this is absolutely worth for visiting place."

CaptainMarlow,49,Jun-18,Jun-18,50,If you are at all interested in the city's history and culture this is a must-see,"My wife and I were advised to visit this museum by numerous friends and it did not disappoint. The History of Singapore section is incredible, beginning with a large wall-projected ancient map, and ending with the modern day. However the real highlight was Story of the Forest in the Rotunda. Amazing. If you are in Singapore, this is a must."

This is just the right place for it to understand the the history of this two big brothers. <br/><br/>The Museum permenant exhibition from Temasik, Clown Colony to Syonan To, In Malaysia for 2 years and finally became Independant just so warming to follow the trail of it. <br/><br/>Its going to cost you a full day if you are really wants to understand the history. Building is well preserved. Great experience!!💯"

Hussain M,203,May-18,Jul-17,50,Create something out of nothing,"For me as a middle eastern guy anything which isn't more than 500 years old is brand new, so you can guess what I thought of singapore that is much newer than that, but to be honest, the museum managed to present its brief history in a very informative elegant way that deserves a stand and applause. History is not much, but embrace what you have."

constantinjoshua,145,May-18,Feb-18,40,"Historical design building, Back to the future","As a Malaysian aka Johorian, who always watch Singapore TV and read a lot of stuff, 95% of the Singapore history already in my mind. Probably it is a good attraction and insight for Non-Malaysian/ Non-Johorian, which need to pay for the ticket. Historical building, good for taking photo, especially couples. For those who love to dive into one country's timeline, it would be a good jump start here."

tsukuba,20,May-18,Apr-18,50,another level of information,"After all the greenery in the jungles, beaches, shopping frenzy and luxury feelings at Orchard, hit the museum to learn more and go a bit deeper what it means to be a Singaporean or to live in Singapore. Done in a user and child friendly manner, it is not boring or exhausting, yet those who like can spend the whole day here, reading and reading all the notes and information. Shall I mention the very efficient air-conditioning? Really a nice soothing break from it all...."

Christa Danica J,188,May-18,May-18,50,Best Museum,"This is a great place to learn more about the history and the beginnings of Singapore. Admission fee is SGD 15.00, a little steep if you don't really have a budget but it is worth-it. Explore the whole building and it would take you about 2-3 hours to finish all galleries and exhibitions. A great place for museum freaks like me. I highly recommend this place."
,,,,,,
ZacMonaco,302,May-18,Apr-18,20,Inaccurate account of Japanese occupation,"I was very disappointed in the exhibition covering the history of Singapore - in particular the section covering the Japanese occupation during WWII.<br/>The exhibition gives the impression that life under Japanese rule wasn’t too bad as long as you followed the rules and got the right permits. There is no mention of Sook Ching which was the systematic killing of members of the Chinese population. Officially Japan claims that fewer than 5,000 deaths occurred, while Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first prime minister, said ""verifiable numbers would be about 70,000"". In 1966 Japan agreed to pay S$50 million in compensation, half of which was a grant and the rest as a loan. They did not make an official apology.<br/>I do not understand how this could not be mentioned in the exhibition or is it that the museum authorities do not wish to offend anyone. Whitewashing history is wrong."
,,,,,,
Ninganoona,203,May-18,May-18,30,It is air conditioned.,A couple of hours respite from the heat. Cost us $15 each to enter.  Interesting presentation of Singapore's development. Learnt some new things. Close to Bencoolen mrt. If you are into history and need some relief from the heat then you will enjoy it more than me.  Not really my thing. I should have gone to bugis to shop!

,,,,,,
John H,319,May-18,Mar-18,50,So Good We Visited Twice,"This museum is part very old and part hyper modern, but it's all well maintained and efficient.  There are excellent lockers available to store backpacks and hats (and strollers).  We hit the last day of a special exhibit on Singapore During World War II, which was very, very well done.  An unadvertized attraction is a glass atrium that's actually a showplace for stunning computer generated images.  We had to visit twice to ensure we had enough photographs to show friends.  There's an excellent ""museum store"" and a a friendly snack bar (plus a very nice linen tablecloth restaurant if you are interested)."
,,,,,,
Zoe B,421,May-18,May-18,30,Not outstanding in any way,"Went here to spend a rainy afternoon whilst on holiday in Singapore. It was ok. Not very well laid out and was told we must start upstairs, so we did and then ended up back on the lower floor totally confused! There is a lot on display but we didnt learn very much about Singapore. Loads of children there but personally I wouldnt recommend as I would think they would be bored, not enough interactive exhibits or much in the way of excitement. Spent a couple of hours strolling around but only go if you have spare time, I certainly wouldnt say its a 'must see'."

GlobetrotterJ16,"1,722",Apr-18,Apr-18,40,Great history lesson,"This beautiful building houses a nice exhibit of Singaporean history, nicely illustrated and laid out, easy to walk through.

Linda D,15,Apr-18,Mar-18,40,Good for History!,We did this to get a bit of an insight into the history of Singapore and I'm glad we did. Small enough to not wear you out but large enough to learn a lot about this lovely little country with a big history.

qiya,55,Apr-18,Apr-18,50,Awesome place to visit when it's raining or when it's toooo hot outside haha,"Embarrassed to say that this is the 1st time I've visited our national museum even thou I'm a citizen here. Therefore, didn't expect to spend that long a time to tour around the place. <br/><br/>Started with a tour of the Singapore history section (free admission for citizens but tourist has to pay a fee for entry) and spent 2.5hours here. Unfortunately, they were closing soon, so had to rush a few parts. As a citizen here, it was very informative, engaging and has some beautiful places to take a few pictures with/of (thou, as per norm, no flash allowed).<br/><br/>Currently, they are holding ""The More We Get Together: Singapore's Playgrounds 1930 – 2030"" exhibition showcasing the experience of growing up in Singapore, which ends on September 2018. Admission is free for all (citizens/tourists), so come along while you're here or if you wish to get away from the heat!"

Duggie1975,53,Apr-18,Apr-18,50,Great place especially if raining,"I am no museum buff but what a great place to visit.....it tells the story of Singapore in such an interactive way on the ground floor then upstairs it marks the progress over time that we all recall whatever our country.....it taught me whatever your country, you play with the same toys ,listen to the same music and watch much of the same TV....brillant. You will need at least 2-3hrs probably come back another day......enjoy"

Mia P,79,Apr-18,Apr-18,50,"If you want to know more about Singapore, go to this place.","Visiting museums is always part of my itinerary, that's why I made it a point to visit National Museum of Singapore on my first day there. There's a $15 SGD entrance fee here but on the day I visited, the place is open to the public for free so I didn't need to pay for anything. I learned a lot during my visit here, especially the pre-colonial era of Singapore and the post-colonial state of the country. It was fun seeing history come to life in this place. There were also other attractions in this place - during the time of my visit, an installation by a French artist was in display."

GKTravellers,"1,064",Apr-18,Apr-18,50,Engaging and informative,"Spent a couple of hours understanding the history of Singapore. The exhbits were well presented and easily understood. The rotunda comprised a vast, unusual and surprising moving graphical display showing a changing natural world."
,,,,,,
DC2florida,382,Apr-18,Apr-18,50,Wow! Great for all ages and so much to see,"This is a great museum for all. It is very accessible to all abilities, disabilities, and ages. The exhibits are very appealing to the eyes, ears, and nose (less to touch though). It is a nice introduction to the history of Singapore -- and that is my only negative in that it leaves out the years of the ""Emergency"" when many were called ""communist"" and imprisoned or executed (though in their defense they could classify that under Malaysian history I suppose, though it had ongoing consequences). Overall the mix of objects, stories, and immersive displays are wonderful for kids and adults."
,,,,,,
DiscoSquirrels,3,Apr-18,Apr-18,50,Very interesting overview of the history of Singapore.,"A beautiful building providing good insight into the history of Singapore. 1-2 hours is enough time to visit, and it is really good to see the museum is free for local residents - only tourists need to pay."

,,,,,,
SingaDiva,25,Apr-18,Feb-18,50,Witness to War was most excellent!,"As expat Singaporeans for the last 6 years, we'd make annual visits to the NMS thoroughly enjoyed the exhibitions. Upon our return in February, we went to appreciate Witness to War &amp; we found it to be the perfect homecoming exhibition for my 13 y/o son &amp; 11 y/o daughter. They inhaled the information &amp; the visuals were riveting! The interactive Family Activity Space called A Child's Perspective was excellent. I also got to bring alive my childhood living in a kampung &amp; shared my parents' &amp; grandparents' war stories, albeit from a distance. <br/>Next we rediscovered the history of Temasek. Always refreshing! Every Singaporean should visit as a family as it showcased vividly the progress of our nation. No spoiler ;)<br/>We had a teatime break at the delightful Food for Thought cafe then soaked in the immersive digital installation Story of the Forest. Enchanting! <br/>Every visitor who wishes to know more about Singapore's history should visit the National Museum."

Arrjun,225,Apr-18,Apr-18,40,A snapshot of Singapore's colourful history,"There aren't too many cities on the planet which can boast of being the confluence of history and of myriad cultures for ages. Singapore, by virtue of its geographical location, has certainly been one and this museum does a fine job of capturing that. <br/>Located close to the university campus, it sees a good number of young people. <br/>Beginning with the Singapore Stone, it traces the impact of the various influences that came into the region - European, Indian Malay, Japanese and showcases the development of Singapore as a modern nation. There is also a great idea for children - a rotunda which showcases the story of the forest. Its a laser-driven display which you walk through as you go up/down a building. Kids will love it.<br/>Nice museum shop also."
,,,,,,
AScottyP,198,Apr-18,Mar-18,50,A special exhibition`,We had some time to spare so decided to visit the museum for a couple of hours.  Staff were most helpful giving us advice on how to get the best out of a short stay.  We visited the WWII exhibition which gave the history of Singapore from its formation through to the present day but with special emphasis on the Japanese occupation from 1942-45.  It was a really good exhibition

The fee per person is 15 Singaporean dollars. It is divided to floors and times intervals. You can see different times closely..

Would recommend if visiting the city - was nice to hear about the key figures in history after whom a lot of streets and areas were named after and understand a lot more about the different cultures.
,,,,,,
Knorts,64,Mar-18,Mar-18,50,Excellent way to gain an understanding of Singapore's history and culture,"We came to Singapore not really knowing what to expect and with little to no understanding of its history and culture. We took a free guided tour that was available from 2pm in the foyer and it was a great way to understand more about the history, culture and outlook of this city nation. The sections I particularly enjoyed related to the 'birth of the nation' featuring very moving footage of Lee Kwan Yew and the section on HDB flats. Unfortunately we missed out on the WWII exhibition by one day. I would suggest visiting at the start of your trip. Very impressive building."

gingerlee13,456,Mar-18,Mar-18,50,Wonderful history museum,"This is a wonderful museum.  I return every year and I'm never disappointed.  This year they featured a special exhibition called ""1942"" that told the events of the year when the Japanese took control of Singapore in World War II.  I took the tour, and the docent was very good.  The exhibits included interactive elements with many first hand accounts of life during that year.  The permanent exhibits are also interesting too.  My only disappointment is that they no longer have a gift shop of any size, since this was a wonderful place to find interesting gifts in the past."

Wendy W,29,Mar-18,Mar-18,50,This museum is worth it!,"We took a taxi from Amara Hotel to the museum. The museum's displays are well though out, informative, interesting, and beautiful. Well worth the time. Let me just say that people in Singapore are great! So nice, helpful, and eager to share about the area and places to eat. Just ask and they open up enthusiastically with recommendations and tips."

AdventuresFirst,37,Mar-18,Mar-18,50,Informative and well done. Could have spent all day there,We unfortunately only had a couple of hours but really wanted to learn more about Singapore. The museum is fascinating and incredibly interesting. I learnt a lot. Done in a way that makes it fascinating beyond the information it provides. Also one of the more reasonably priced museums. We’re students so it was only 10SGD
,,,,,,
almclint,55,Mar-18,Mar-18,50,Very informative,"Prior to visiting we knew little about Singapore’s history, we found the exhibitions to be informative and organised. Although we were not travelling with children a lot of the exhibition is multi sensory, meaning it would be enjoyable for a variety of ages. Museum was very clean, well maintained and situated by Fort Canning Park in a beautiful area.<br/><br/>Best of all, it was free!"

razorfishsalt,150,Mar-18,Mar-18,50,Beautiful space and excellent interpretation,Well worth a stroll around if only for the space alone but the interpretation carries you through the braided river like evolution of Singapore as it is today<br/>The Japanese high tech exhibit was a wonderful bonus
,,,,,,
Aberdeenyummymummy,85,Mar-18,Mar-18,40,Very educational,The history of Singapore told in an interesting and informative way. Loses a dot for charging $15 entry fee for an adult - not including the special exhibition (which would have made it $26 total) which would make it pricey for a family.

gpagot,201,Mar-18,Mar-18,30,Nice historical museum.,"Very good section on the WW2 part of Singapore's history. A little expensive, compared to National Gallery and Asian Civilisations, and maybe not fully worth it."

,,,,,,
Peter Scheer,321,Mar-18,Mar-18,50,What a concept ,"We bought the combo ticket. So we visited the war exhibition as well as the exhibition of the forest.<br/>In the end it was the war again.<br/>Such a theconcept: the atrocities of war committed by Japanese, the beauty forest depicted by Japanese artists and in the end how Singapur became such a prosperous country. Politics and depicting its presidential family.<br/>Even the little restaurant is nice."

cherylathol,10,Mar-18,Mar-18,50,History of Singapore,"Enjoyed our visit, beautiful building with an excellent restaurant and cafe. Many extra galleries. Their was also one on Changi experiences which was very interesting.<br/>You need atlas 2 hours or more to take it all in."
,,,,,,
stumblethru,61,Mar-18,Feb-18,50,Comprehensive insight into Singaporean history,"I visited the museum in the last few weeks of the 1942 exhibit, which was a special exhibit dedicated to the experiences of Singaporean residents during and after the fall of Singapore. It is comprehensive and personable, with stories from both adults and children who lived through a horrific time in Singapore history.<br/><br/> Also very worth seeing is the last 100 years of Singapore which divides the last 100 years into four rooms exhibiting how Singaporeans lived and how the city grew and changed over the years. For an even more in depth exploration of Singapore's history you can visit the exhibit that explores all the way back to before Singapore was made a British colony to today. <br/><br/>My favourite part other than 1942 was the beautiful forest in the Rotunda. Stunning beautiful graphics. Well worth taking the kids to."
,,,,,,
GKL199,33,Mar-18,Feb-18,50,Interesting to visit,The museum is a place worth making the time to visit. It would be good to catch one of the guided tours. We caught the one at 11 a.m. It is a great way to educate oneself on the history of Singapore. This visit more than met our expectations.
,,,,,,
Ashley Liew,293,Mar-18,Mar-18,50,Iconic Singaporean landmark with 130 years of history,"This is museum is a must-visit, whether visitor or citizen of Singapore. In fact, admission is free to all citizens and permanent residence, which further encourages us to appreciate our roots and embrace our history. It had been a long time since I last visited the museum in schooling days, drawn this time to the ""Witness to War"" exhibit. It may not have been as full of exhibits and activities compared to the massive WWII museum I visited in New Orleans (USA), but it was still special especially because of the local context of ordinary courageous men and women struggling to preserve humanity amidst the occupation. We finished this exhibit in an hour but it left a lasting impression on us. Do check out the other exhibits as well and if you can also sign up for the free guided tours. There is much to learn about this ""little red dot"" of Singapore! P.S. parking may be limited especially on weekends but we were still able to find a lot easily when we visited."

Jeremy C,224,Mar-18,Feb-18,40,Good museum in a lovely building,"Great if you like visiting museums and it is located in a lovely building.

Puneite_10,60,Mar-18,Feb-18,40,"Great building, great history",The building of the National museum is very cleverly extended at the back. Singapore's histrory is interesting and is shown in an interesting manner. I think all tourists need to make a visit.

LizCoward,15,Mar-18,Mar-18,50,Try to get to one of the free Monday Morning Lectures,"This is a modern, well-thought out museum staffed with highly trained and informative Docents (guides). It's light and airy and easy to navigate. The cafe is a bit pricey."

YazEscoffie,146,Mar-18,Sep-17,40,All you need to know about the history of Singapore!,"If you have interest in economics and history, this is a must go, specially is you are not very familiar with this country. The visit helps you to understand the culture and economical stability of the country."
,,,,,,
Ogi0,"11,598",Mar-18,Mar-18,30,It is not worth a special visit,"The museum is dedicated to the history of Singapore, but it is not very interesting and very poor. The most interesting thing is the Story of the Forest art installation."
,,,,,,
JimmyGalaxy,334,Mar-18,Mar-18,50,Absolute must visit when in town.,"If you love history this is a great place and a must. Loved the quality of displays and how the information was laid out. I knew very little about Singapore and it’s history but left feeling really well immersed.<br/><br/>They have done a fantastic job at keeping the quality of the exhibits updated and reflecting the best of modern big city museums.<br/><br/>The building is well air conditioned with great toilets, gift shop and cafe.<br/>Really easy to get to and close to local MRT (tube) it took me about 25 mins to walk down to the Marina afterwards."

Alanna L,38,Mar-18,Mar-18,40,Beautiful building,"I went here with 2 hours to kill before my flight home, I found it a little hard to navigate, I bought a general ticket for $15 but was unsure what I could access and couldn't. Still was a very interesting visiting learning about Singapore history. Loved the heritage building combined with modern extension on the back."

Judyannechan,114,Mar-18,Feb-18,50,Very interesting,"We saw the special exhibit on WWII which was very interesting.  We took the guided tour.  Our guide was very pleasant &amp; informative.  We also viewed the gallery on,the history of Singapore which I really liked.  It was laid in a very clear manner, nice exhibits &amp; artifacts.  There is so much information.  The Museum is housed in a lovely old building with a newer part added on in the back.  We also had lunch there.  They have a gift shop as well.  There were more galleries to see but we had to leave them for another day.  You could easily spend an entire day in the Museum as there is so much to see."

,,,,,,
SingaporeanLime,4,Mar-18,Feb-18,40,Modernised elements added to National Museum of 130 years,"Another ideal museum to learn about Singapore's history, especially for families with children. Recommended to start the tour from Galleries or Story of the Forest (digital installations) at Level 2 first, walking through Singapore's history Gallery. It would be great to visit special exhibitions in Basement floor, if there is sufficient availability of time. Also very accessible location getting to Fort Canning Park from back of this Museum."
,,,,,,
mousefindsout,198,Mar-18,Feb-18,50,A must for anyone wanting to understand this wonderful country and its heritage,"An impressive permanent collection covering the earliest peoples to live here through the various periods in history including the British colonial era and the war and the transition to Independence. I found it fascinating and well laid out. They also have temporary installations in the Exhibition Galleries at basement level for which you have the option to pay extra. Currently until the 25th March 2018 it is Witness to War, which I found moving as it featured the personal stories of survivors in this bitter chapter in Singapore’s history. For me a must see museum if you are interested in history and in gaining an insight into this amazing country. There is a good café and a nice looking restaurant called Flutes."
,,,,,,
jc07perth,133,Mar-18,Feb-18,40,Interesting Exhibition on WWII in Singapore,"we found the Witness to War exhibition to be very interesting, seeing the world in 1942 from a Singaporean perspective.<br/>They have snippets from different films that were done around the time of the war and items like a WWII shelter for families and how they lived and coped with coming to terms with the invasion by the Japanese.<br/>they also had on of the Japanese officers samurai sword which was used in Singapore.<br/>This all prompted me to do some more research on this period due to my children's great uncle being in Z Force and I found an amazing book written by a historian called Deadly Secrets by Lynette Silver which gave me another insight into what happened in Singapore.<br/>I did not realise how many locals Malay and Chinese lost their lives very bravely, so humbled by this and thank you to the museum for starting me on this journey."

jdc8mbc,558,Feb-18,Dec-17,40,Worthy of a visit - great place for lunch,"Take a break from the heat and humidity and visit this air-conditioned museum which tracks the founding, growth and development of Singapore from multiple perspectives including geological, cultural, historical, sociological, political and technological.  Enter the Glass Rotunda on the top level and view the digitally produced Story of the Forest based on natural history drawings.  The hands-on children's museum is fabulous in depicting life in Singapore.  The Food for Thought restaurant offers appetizing and reasonably-priced dishes - we had a satisfying and hearty mushroom soup and delicious fish and chips."
,,,,,,
mtrodgers99,342,Feb-18,Feb-18,40,Educational museum,"The museum has a lot of reading. It is informative, but if you do not care to read, you won’t get a lot out of going to the museum. The temporary exhibition during our visit was about the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. It was done in a similar style as the rest of the museum, but more artifacts."
,,,,,,
Rootz,226,Feb-18,Feb-18,50,Awesome place to know the history of Singapore,"Had a great day at the National Museum. You could literally spent the whole day just going thru what Singapore was, and how we went thru those trying times.<br/><br/>Currently, as of Feb 2018, there is an exhibition on the Occupation Period of 1942 during WW2. It is a great learning experience for both the young and the old.<br/><br/>Being your family there! For you won't regret the time spent here. You can always have lots of fun in Singapore, but you can't always learn about the history."
,,,,,,
RobininBRISTOL,"1,153",Feb-18,Feb-18,50,A must visit,Apart from the wonderful building and the stylish extension this answers so many questions. Life under Japanese rule was haunting - same feeling of being abandoned as the Channel Islanders must have felt.  The ambition of a tolerant rainbow nation is clearly set out.  Most moving scene for me was the press conference on leaving Malaysia - such sadness but such hope.
,,,,,,
Brad D,30,Feb-18,Feb-18,40,Informative museum,"Great detailed history of the island, the people, and the nation. Very detailed, but nothing especially unique about this museum compared to other national museums. It's pretty much exactly what you would expect from a museum."
,,,,,,
Ed T,120,Feb-18,Feb-18,40,Great way to get out of the sun for a couple hours,A long line to purchase tickets but it moved quickly.  Explored 2 levels and multiple exhibits on the basic $15 entry.  Took 2 hours and we seen the history from a fishing village to a modern city.  There was good information without being too much. Quite enjoyed ourselves and glad we went.
,,,,,,
Harlie R,101,Feb-18,Feb-18,50,We spent so much time here,"I was shocked at how much there was to see at this museum, I learned so much about Singapore’s history and there were so many galleries and exhibits, it’s easy to spend 2-4 hours here in my opinion. Good for all ages I think."
,,,,,,
Ssaravanan1,48,Feb-18,Feb-18,50,Nice place for day out,"Well maintained and organized. Good place to spend with your children and teach them the history more practically. Nowadays I can see more video display which is available everywhere. Apart from this, great place to visit to learn Singapore history."
,,,,,,
Family0fFiveNL,34,Feb-18,Feb-18,30,Quick bit of history,"This museum does a decent job of showing you interesting bits of Singapore history in small doses.  There are four or six galleries that break down history into 10 year periods which are quick to see if you don't want to spend all day in a museum.  And well done as well.  Also, right now - Feb 2018 - there is an excellent exhibit about the Japanese occupation of 1942. Best part are the oral histories of actual survivors. You stand in a circular space listening to their first hand account and watch pencil and ink sketches depicting the events as they tell it. SUPERB!"
,,,,,,
L2912UBs,741,Feb-18,Feb-18,20,Judge for yourself ,"My immediate observation was of disappointment. Disappointment that such a beautiful city full of fascinating history that occurred in recent times, is displaying minimalist facts and most in dark rooms. <br/>The steps through the major periods are conservative, and yet in reality were dynamic.<br/>The rotunda is a space that could take you through an experience of life lived through the many wars, habitants, and technology. <br/><br/>This is my view and I sincerely wish the museum to become what it is not now, an experience that captures the viewer."
,,,,,,
alank-london,266,Feb-18,Jan-18,50,Fantastic history lesson,"Worth half a day of anyone's time. The wide range of exhibits, comprehensive but not overdone, tell Singapore's story from backwater fishing village to multicultural modern city. The museum tackles British colonialism head on, highlighting the things the locals value as well as less comfortable stories. It's an inspiring story. Take one of the free volunteer-led tours, for a friendly and informative starter, then wander at leisure around the beautifully airy building, which is a pleasure in itself. Entry is not expensive especially with the concessions for seniors and students. A must in Singapore."

cornwall48,33,Feb-18,Feb-18,50,great museum,"this is a great museum to visit. you can spend hours here. so much to see. at the moment there is a major exhibition on the fall of Singapore, which is very well presented.the wow factor for me is the story of the forest. this is a digital projection inside a dome. flowers a blooming overhead.and as u walk down a slope the forest is around u. at the bottom u lie on your back and look up at the cascading flowers and the forest around u.don't miss this it is brilliant!!!!"

,,,,,,
Watsson,416,Feb-18,Feb-18,30,Left me disappointed,The focus here is Singapore history. I'm a history buff and so was looking forward to my visit.  I can't put my finger on why but this museum was something of a snooze. Surely the history of Singapore can be told with more pizzazz.
,,,,,,
Jo D,149,Feb-18,Jan-18,40,Really lovely building and very good exhibits,"We visited the Museum to visit a specific exhibition - about Singapore and WWII - Witness to War: Remembering 1942. Exhibition was excellent and there are guides on site to take you through the exhibit. <br/>Museum itself was also well presented, general exhibits really well presented. <br/>A lovely building that's had modern addition - reminded me of London's Tate Modern in parts. Has a very nice gift shop and a cafe on site too."
,,,,,,
Brian M,490,Feb-18,Jan-18,40,Worth a visit,When we visited there was a marvellous exhibition of the development of Singapore. There was also a wonderful video experience of he rainforest for children I suppose but adults found it fascinating. There are two restaurants at the Museum. Unfortunately the high end restaurant was fully booked with an event. The more down market restaurant was fine for our needs.

,,,,,,
Ilmar T,437,Jan-18,Jan-18,50,Great Historic collection,"What I really liked about the museum was the effort to present an unbiased view of the history of Singapore in uncluttered and easy to follow galleries. The building itself was beautifully preserved. What I didn't know was that throughout the Japanese occupation the museum continued to operate as normal under both European and Japanese curators working together, and that huge amounts of documents and artworks were transferred from other collections to the museum to protect them and preserve them from destruction. A great place for any visitor to Singapore to spend a few hours."
,,,,,,
TravelDreams,250,Jan-18,Jan-18,50,First rate history museum,"i was very impressed with the different ways that the museum conveyed history- documents, films, audio, art.  There were parts that you really feel that you are in that era- the opium dens and Malaysia separation come to mind.  I loved the temporary exhibit called Story of a Forest.  The cafe was also nice.  Very elegant and clean museum."
,,,,,,
Wohlerguy,359,Jan-18,Jan-18,40,Provides a quick history of Singapore,"We liked this because in less than 2 hours, we were able to get a good grasp on the history of Singapore, which dates back to the 14th century. We found that the most interesting part was from the 19th century forward, with two critical times being during WW II and from independence in 1965. One thing that we felt the museum could use is more opportunities to sit for a few moments while making one's way through the exhibits. Definitely worth a visit if you have any desire to know a bit more about the history of this fascinating city state."
,,,,,,
BernhardK1,207,Jan-18,Jan-18,50,Do not miss this museum in Singapore!,"The main reason we went was because we saw and ad for the WWII exhibit and we were blown away, both by the temporary exhibit but also the permanent collection. If you are interested in the history of Singapore and you also want to see an amazingly restored and extended building come here.<br/>You will learn about all aspects of Singapore's history, the artifacts and immersive nature of the collection is really well done. A must see!"

thitiporn_nicole,62,Jan-18,Sep-17,50,Impressive Place,One of the place that I could recommend to everyone who visit Singapore.. Because there are always a few exhibition going on and also you will know more about Singapore.. Glad that I have time to go there to explore..

Howard B,229,Jan-18,Jan-18,50,Wonderful Art,"Great museum filled with ancient and modern Chinese art and exhibitions. We also saw a wonderful Musee D'Orsay exhibition of expressinist and impressionist art. Also, the buildings are as unique as the art."

I joined a free guided tour which latest about an hour and took us through the main exhibit on the history of Singapore, our guide was knowledgeable and able to add a personal touch to the story which I liked, I would definitely recommend doing the tour. The museum is very history focused, and quite traditional. If you want to learn more about this fascinating Country, this is a good place to come. You could spend 1-2 hours here and just see the highlights, or half a day really going through everything."

I will say your visit is incomplete without your visit to NMS. We took pass for permanent Galleries which was for SG$15. All access pass was for SG$25. With our pass we were allowed to visit level 1 and 2. History of Singapore and in level 2, five Galleries focussing on humble beginning to present day metropolis. Despite its rich historic background the museum adopts the cutting edge display techniques redefining traditional museum experience.<br/>Open 10 am to 7 pm.

Seonyul G,12,Jan-18,Jan-18,50,A great cultural experience!,"Spent half of my day getting to know the history and culture of Singapore and it was time well spent! Foreigners need to pay for the ticket which is about 15 Singaporean Dollars. When I was there there's a special exhibit going on where you have to pay higher to get a ticket for. However, just the regular ticket is already enough if you just want to get to know Singapore."

From where it was just an ""island"" &gt; seaport &gt; colony of GB &gt; Independence &gt; modern-day Singapore. Very well organized mixed with multi-media exhibits. <br/>One memorable moment is to watch late father of the nation LKY on TV announcing the birth of the new nation. Very touching and gained even more respect for him."

J07sc0tland,342,Jan-18,Dec-17,50,Amazing place,"We visit Singapore frequently and always enjoy visits to both the Museum and the Gallleries. Apart from the obvious exhibits to see They always have good cafes and the facilities for children are excellent The animated show in the Rotunda was amazing, culminating in an area that showed a night scene with bean bags to lie on. I am finding words can not describe it you will just have to go and see for yourself."

Philip1120,430,Jan-18,Dec-17,50,Excellent multimedia displays tell the story of Singapore,"I'm not a huge fan of museums, if truth be told; I have found so many to be dead boring. This one isn't. Housed in a splendid colonial building dating from 1887, it includes various multimedia displays and interactive exhibits that explain in an engaging way the history of Singapore. Having spent part of my childhood living in Singapore in the 1950s, the museum offered a fascinating insight into what life was like back then and how it has changed since.<br/><br/>I ate in the museum's bright and airy café, 'Food for Thought' (there is a restaurant, but it looked rather posh and expensive). The café was a little pricey and service was slow and erratic, but the food (including fish and chips!) was pretty good."
,,,,,,
Chip D,59,Jan-18,Jan-18,50,So much to see,Love the building and the architecture. The review and focus on the war and what happened to the building I thoroughly enjoyed. If you like history this is the place to go and see how the war went for the British. Take at least 4 hours to see what you are paying for.
,,,,,,
cherriesfan_9,"6,384",Jan-18,Dec-17,50,Two excellent exhibitions,"This imposing building with its classical lines and impressive dome is adjacent to Fort Canning Park.<br/>Admission fee is waived for Singapore nationals, everyone else pays.<br/>Currently there is an excellent temporary exhibition ""Witness to War; Remembering 1942"" and there is a more permanent section on another floor ""We built a Nation"", which explores and illustrates the years 1965 to 1975 - a highly significant time which built the foundations of this highly successful island nation.<br/>Both exhibits are equally worth your time to view, and are in any case very professionally presented.<br/>An excellent museum, and certainly not a collection of stuffy relics."

JBV87,10,Jan-18,Dec-17,40,Wonderful exhibits on a fascinating history,"We only had time to visit the history gallery, which does a great job of showing how/why Singapore has evolved over the years. Highly recommended for anyone with any interest in history."

Sandie N,133,Jan-18,Jan-18,40,Interesting,Very interesting. The history of Singapore. Well worth a visit if you do not know it’s history.  Nice and cool inside for a break from the humidity.

Monica T,22,Jan-18,Dec-17,50,Lovely museum,"I love this museum with great information about the history of Singapore. They demonstrate with old pics, maps, activities and historical stuffs to tell the Singapore history which is easy to read and understand. They also offer free guide tour to visitors. I like the tour guide who tell the founding story of Singapore, which makes the visit even more fun!"

sarahQ7370OX,82,Jan-18,Jan-18,50,Brilliant museum that is a credit to Singapore,"This is one of best museums that I have visited. It is well laid out in a beautiful building that is so easy to get to. The staff are incredibly helpful. If you like history and learning about Singapore, it’s people and how the nation was shaped, this is the place for you. They have a wonderful app as well"

Suzy P,126,Jan-18,Jan-18,50,Loved it. ,"I love history and museums so this was a home run for me. Great way to get out of the heat, and learn about the history of Singapore. I spent a lot of time walking around the city during my trip so having a historical background on many of the areas and how the city was built was great. I spent majority of my time in the main Singapore history exhibit which is very well done. It is also extensive, I spent a good hour and half in that exhibit alone. It only took me another 30 minutes to go through the other exhibits on the 2nd floor. I did not pay extra to go to the 1940's exhibit. <br/><br/>Great museum. If you love history, this is the place for you. Also anyone who loves fashion - don't miss the exhibit on the 2nd floor with Singapore fashion - really cool."
,,,,,,
Peppy A,79,Jan-18,Dec-17,40,Great way to learn,We were there for a family holiday with young children. We love Southeast Asian history and we wanted our children to learn as well. Visiting this museum is time well spent. Staff were so friendly and the history was so rich. I rate this place highly as my children learnt in a fun way.

Hema B,540,Jan-18,Nov-17,50,A  nation built by migrants...so amazing..,"During our travels..at times we take certain things for granted including historical museums that really tells you a nation's story of how a country is led. This is Singapore's  amazing story of how its generation of leaders help built a nation comprising of immigrants from China, India, Malaysia and the Dutch East Indies. Its history dates back to 1849 and its the oldest museum in  Singapore. Free admission for all Singaporeans and those foreign expats with a Singapore PR. Its huge and its outlook has a very colonial infrastructure as its a Commonwealth  country with alot of British heritage . The exhibition was on Remembering the War (1942-1945). Its easy to get there by car or even by taxi. <br/>I was intrigued by the historical  separation of Singapore from Malaysia and being a Malaysian.. I wanted to know the real reason for its separation in 1963.  Each gallery  tells an insightful story of  Singaopore's cultures, traditions and history.  There's also a guided tour if anyone needs it. The staff are friendly and accomodating. The leaflets are self explanatory ...so you cannot get lost. Lots of pics and documentary on its first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. I<br/>Its worth a trip. It would be enjoyable for all ages. We spent a good 3 hours there as we took our time."

Nunngo,"1,601",Jan-18,Jan-18,50,Rich in history of Singapore,"Great information on the history of Singapore.  This museum is loaded with displays, so much to see and read.  We wondered in expecting that a couple of hours would do us but 3 1/2 hours later we left with a loaded brain, not having seen the lot.  Great old historic building, lots of space and uncrowded displays."

carmelmarees,5,Jan-18,Dec-17,50,2 ladies with  calipers,"A beautiful building!. The staff were accommodating with mum and her calipers with her slow walking pace.   I saw this building from  Hotel Rendevous, and a large banner for an exhibition titled ""Witness to War Remembering 1942"" .  We went across to appreciate the building and to visit the exhibition which was sombre and so well done. From snooping in the gift shop I came across a brochure on The Battle Box tours  in Fort Canning.  It all tied in  together and gave a massive history punch on the Fall of Singapore.  Museums are not stuffy this is light and airy and relaxing."

Winnie W,88,Jan-18,Jan-18,50,Museum for the young and old,"Fantastic museum about the history of Singapore, very fascinating for the adults as well as children. We had 5 kids with ages ranging from 1-12 years old, all finding the visit fun and educational. Strongly recommended if you are into history."

Andrew C,13,Dec-17,Jan-18,40,Insight into Singapore,"As a Singaporean, visiting the renovated museum gives me an insight into thr history of Singapore. From the founding days to modern times, the museum brings guests through a timeline of Singapire history. The museum is large with many exhibits, and is very modern and informative. The trip was very enjoyable overall for the whole family. <br/><br/>On a side note, the museum is free for all Singaporeans and free for all on public holidays."

NigelBN,211,Dec-17,Oct-17,40,A refuge from the humidity but also very interesting,OK. Confession time. We're generally not museum buffs. But we were looking for somewhere to spend a few hours before we flew home.  Air conditioning was first priority. Interesting place to be came a close second.<br/><br/>We went round 2 exhibitions during our visit as well as stopping for tea and cake.  We also looked around some of the more permanent parts.  We found it all to be engaging and very pleasant. No hustle. No rush. And thought-provoking content.

,,,,,,
Kare10,8,Dec-17,Dec-17,50,My favourite place,I'm a born bred Singaporean . Yes.. Singaporean go in free. But way before that must pay. And I did pay. I don't mind paying to know more about history of Singapore.  Though by now history books should have told us enough.  But now more interactive activities at level 2 of museum. Have to walk about more. I been there more then 10 times and I never get bored going to museum . To each is own. U may love it or hate it. But I love my museum on Singapore . Definitely can't compare to overseas museum as our history is much lesser then other country. Hope this helps!

Shelley J,821,Dec-17,Dec-17,50,Understanding Singapore,This museum is a must visit in Singapore if you’re keen to understand Singapore’s history and place in the world.  There’s a great display charting Singapore’s development and history and an excellent display on Singapore during WWII. It’s in a beautiful building not far from Marina Bay...a cab ride cost less than $10. There’s good coffee in the cafe behind the museum shop. Well worth a visit.

David,911,Dec-17,Dec-17,50,Excellent museum. ,"Like the rest of Singapore, this museum is impressive. The architecture is pretty stunning - juxtaposing an old colonial building with a cavernous, multi-storey annex.<br/><br/>I only had time to visit two of the galleries. The first was the Singapore history gallery, which was a really excellent introduction to the history of this city state.<br/><br/>I also visited a second gallery which contains a collection of objects gifted by the former prime minister.<br/><br/>Sadly didn't have time to visit more of the galleries. I can certainly recommend going if you are in SG."

,,,,,,
JohnTraveller8,43,Dec-17,Dec-17,40,Special exhibits are worth a visit,"Singapore has several good museums including the National Museum of Singapore. This Museum has both standard exhibits and special exhibits - in early December, this was showing IMPRESSIONIST paintings on loan from France. While this exhibition did not show a large number of paintings, it did exhibit some of the most important artists during the IMPRESSIONIST period including paintings from Monet, Renoir and Cezanne. <br/>Importantly, the history of IMPRESSIONIST painting was laid out in a sensible historical way.<br/>I enjoyed this visit."
,,,,,,
Anand2107,160,Dec-17,Oct-17,50,Pricey but worth a visit,National Museum provides a good glimpse into the history of Singapore. They have many timely exhibitions which are worth a visit.<br/><br/>Overall pricey but worth going once.

Ed G,134,Dec-17,Dec-17,50,Great History Lesson,Had spent Saturday outside and decided Sunday would be best spent indoors in air conditioning! Was staying very close to Museum and had a recommendation from a local. Very well done exhibit on the history of Singapore that took a couple hours to go through at a comfortable pace. The other exhibits were okay - but the history section had the most impact.
,,,,,,
jedm49,86,Dec-17,Dec-17,40,WORTH A VISIT FOR HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF SINGAPORE,"It is worth a visit to the National Museum if you want to learn the historical perspective on the development of Singapore. The first floor highlights the beginnings when it was not much more than a village to where it is now. It is well done with lots of audio and visual, all of which was in working order. We spent about an hour and a half which is probably about average."
,,,,,,
TheWholeTruthES,524,Dec-17,Dec-17,40,Pricey but interesting nevertheless,"At. SG$ 19 for a senior discounted ticket I find it very very expensive. So if you know or are not interested in Singapore History give it a wide berth.<br/><br/>I found it interesting and informative, much more so than the readings I had done before coming to Singapore.<br/><br/>The exhibits are nothing out of the ordinary but they do provide a sense of the history of the Island and the special exhibition of the Japanese occupation during WWII was also interesting.<br/><br/>There is however at least one big mistake in the panels. Governor St. George Ord in his 1875 portrait, oil on canvas, is certainly NOT in a military uniform. It is a Colonial Service uniform, which has minor differences with the Foreign Service Uniform."
,,,,,,
Orange_Penguins,54,Dec-17,Dec-17,50,Really well done,"We were initially taken back at the high cost but ended up spending 6 hours here because there was so much to see! It was all really well presented and provided a really good overview of Singapore’s history and achievements. There’s also a lovely cafe where we enjoyed lunch - some veggie options available. One the best museums we’ve been to, really recommend."

Michelle D,27,Dec-17,Nov-17,50,"IT WOULD BE REMISS OF YOU NOT TO VISIT, WHEN IN SINGAPORE","Amazing building and beautifully curated world class museum. The story of Singapore is extremely interesting and emotive. It will appeal to all ages. Need to spend a couple of hours here. It isn't surprising that this beautiful country has evolved to what it is today, when you understand the struggles and the commitment of Singapore's incredible leaders."

Dabblings,"1,325",Dec-17,Nov-17,40,Excellent museum in beautiful building.,"The history of Singapore was very well presented in this beautiful building. I enjoyed the top floor how it was split into decades &amp; the occupation years from 1942 - 1945 was very sad.<br/>I felt that the costume area could have been better presented. the models were plain grey with no features, they needed a basic face &amp; hair!  The ancient history &amp; colonial history was very good, but we ran out of time to see all of it.  There's a beautiful restaurant to the left of the entrance &amp; the rotunda is an excellent event/display area."

Amrreeta D,12,Dec-17,Aug-17,50,Lovely place to visit for an hour,"My friend loves visiting museums, but I wasn't too keen. When I went there I loved the art and the greenery around the museum. Click lots of pictures against the white building architecture."

Trevor797,58,Dec-17,Dec-17,40,Fascinating Guide to Singapore History,"The National Museum is close to a few MRT stations and definitely worth a visit. The displays are varied in style with a lot of audio and visual material as well as artifacts. The dedicated display at the moment is Witness to War : Remembering 1942 which is a well thought out and sobering guide to the lives of a variety of Singaporeans during the War. A decision to illustrate their stories through large scale animation is a clever one, making it at once personal and accessible"

cherietomkins,88,Dec-17,Nov-17,50,Awesome,"We walked to the museum and when we walked in we were excited about what t we were going to see,  the glass show as you walked around was mind blowing it took our breathe away we couldn't stop saying how fabulous it was this museum is a must see and you can get seniors which is great"

Zayd A,10,Nov-17,Jul-17,30,Not that exciting!,"The National Museum wasn't that appealing to a foreign tourist. There wasn't much help at the help desk and it was quite gloomy. On top of that, the unreasonable price couldn't be matched to the lowly facilities that they offered. Luckily for us, we entered from the back entrance (straight road from the Battlebox) which basically gave us a free entry."

John H,132,Nov-17,Nov-17,50,Singapore History Well Showcased,We had the guided tour of the war experience which as always is brought to life by personal stories.I enjoyed most of the exhibits although for a very modern country finding suitable exhibits must be difficult.The temporary forest exhibition was fantastic and worth the admission on its own. I thought that the cafeteria menu and ambience poor and you have to wait to be seated.<br/>There was a discount for the over 60s worth remembering at admission.

peperi,208,Nov-17,Nov-17,40,Well presented displays of Singapore history,The museum is worth a visit to understand the history and culture of Singapore. The displays showing the influence of trade on the evolution of the city-state and its impact on lifestyles in the different communities that make up the state are fascinating and insightful. <br/>The accounts of the impact of the Japanese occupation during WWII are harrowing while the personal stories recounted are inspiring. Well worth the visit and investing a couple of hours exploring.
,,,,,,
Wayne J,95,Nov-17,Nov-17,50,Good to see early in your visit,"It's an excellent museum - interesting and well laid out. Understandably parochial, but never off-puttingly so. Ended up spending a couple of hours here, and could have stayed longer.<br/><br/>Taking it in at the start of a trip would really put much of the modern day Singapore that you encounter as a visitor into context."

exquisitektc,241,Nov-17,Nov-17,50,Best Museum Featuring Singapore's History,"Of all the museums that we have visited in Singapore, the NMS documents Singapore's past, present, and future most comprehensively. The NMS is broken up into sections and tickets are sold for each exhibition or as a combination thereof. We opted for the Singapore History Gallery initially. However, we ended up having to return to see the other exhibitions.<br/><br/>The best pieces of advice are to (1) arrive early, (2) purchase admission to all exhibitions, and (3) plan to spend an entire day at the museum. Food and beverage are available, so is car/scooter/bike parking. If you do not have time to spend the whole day here, do a little research and decide on what is more important. For us, that is Singapore history!<br/><br/>The guided tour was nice. The guide was knowledgeable and provided useful information not available on the panels. However, if you are not a part of the tour, the tour guides can be quite loud, but not louder than children running around and yelling (downside)."

Vincent L,73,Oct-17,Oct-17,50,I learnt a lot about Singapore's history ! (I'm from France),"First time for me in Asia, so I went to NMS to learn history about the part of the world.<br/>It was fantastic. FYI I'm from France, the ""Old Europe"", and was not so much aware about history of Singapore. This museum gave me clear information from the ""creation"" of the town, its development, its strenght.<br/><br/>I really appreciated the level 1 ""Singapore History Gallery"" with a really well organized learning trip. Then the second thing is about the special exhibition ""Witness to war"". As I said for World War II I'm most familiar with war in Europe, but there I was able to learn a lot about this part of the world during WWII ! <br/><br/>It's to be done if you come to visit Singapore, really ! (Also If you are like me far far away from home :-) )"

Charne T,90,Oct-17,Oct-17,50,Great place to visi,"This is the second time I’ve visited in 2 years. Spent several hours in the History of Singapore wing and didn’t get to see anything else this time.

Scoutwonderworld,169,Oct-17,Oct-17,50,Excellent explanation of Singapore History,Absolutely loved this museum. It explained everything you need to know about Singapore. We learned in depth history of pre WWII and after. The mind set of the government and why and what they do. It explains why the city is full of trees and is so clean. It explains the suffering the locals endured during WWII. The other exhibits were amazing as well. They had a really cool interactive video garden.  Hard to explain... You just need to go see for yourself. It is a visual paradise.

Graeme R,88,Oct-17,Oct-17,50,Day visit,"This is an excellent, well laid out and very informative museum.<br/>There is both a cafe and full restaurant in the facility.  Entrance is S$10 (Senior). Exhibits are most professional and very very interesting. Singapore has a fascinating history!<br/>Well worth the visit and easy to a access by walking/MRT."
,,,,,,
Jimclevs,74,Oct-17,Oct-17,50,WHERE ARE THE STREET SIGNS?!,"We eventually got here (on a typical hot and steamy Singapore day) after exiting the Bras Basah MRT station to be confronted by numerous modern office blocks and no directions to this national museum - the first one we saw was directly outside the museum with an arrow pointing to the entrance!  Luckily my phone was able to point us in the right direction.<br/><br/>As for the museum - we spent over 4 hours in there viewing the various collections - some permanent and others of a temporary nature.  The current one depicting the Fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942 was very well laid out, clear to understand and a worthwhile addition to the entry price (if you are passing through as a stopover in the city - keep your boarding pass as it entitles you to discounted pricing on various attractions, one of which is this museum).<br/><br/>There is a small cafe onsite, not the cheapest in the city and the quality was variable, but if you are looking for something more substantial (and much pricier) the excellent Flutes restaurant is onsite (and the equally pricey Janice Wong place in the same building)"

Diedre_8,89,Oct-17,Oct-17,50,Wonderful Exhibitons,Had a Sunday morning exploring this wonderful museum.  So much to see we enjoyed the exhibition which showed the development of Singapore &amp; the war years.  It is an amazing insight into how such an extraordinary City came to be.  <br/>The war years are also very thought provoking and extremely personal.

CorinGL,243,Oct-17,Oct-17,50,Worth paying to see all exhibits,"My visit to Singapore’s National Museum today was well worth the SG$26 entry fee giving me access to all permanent and special exhibits. <br/><br/>I started with the history gallery, the biggest at the museum, and it was very interesting spanning from the 14th century to modern times, including their invasion by Japan in 1942 during WWII. <br/><br/>I later visited the forest exhibit on level 2, an animated exhibit projected on the walls as you walk down a spiral walkway. An app allows you interaction with the exhibit should you choose. <br/><br/>Other exhibits included childhood toys, more about experiences and times during the Japanese occupation, and colonial times. <br/><br/>Well worth a visit, enjoyed mine."

Also a showing on the walls of a round  centre, of a light show ,  Singapore through the ages of animals etc."

The city has been through and succeeded admirably in so many ways and I expected more in depth.<br/>In fact, I left with more questions than I started with and I went back to my hotel to do some heavy googling."

Ianjweis,22,Oct-17,Sep-17,30,"Beautiful colonial building, shlick presentation, but didn't learn much about Singapore","The history section on the ground floor was the best bit, but it was still a little empty. It touched on the key stages in the history of Singapore, but there was no depth, no discussion and no tension. In fact, I had trouble working out a story as I moved from room to room, just artifacts and portraits and points in time. Suddenly brittish appear, suddenly there's a malaysian independence, then suddenly, there's independent singapore.  Singapore is such a melting pot, it would have been good to see the Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist cultures learning to live together (with both ups and downs), the struggle with Colonial powers, and the wider Malaysia and the trials of becoming a modern city.  Maybe this museum is more for the locals and assumes we already know the details."

Widyandaru,44,Oct-17,Nov-16,50,A museum that you have to visit in SG,"For 10 SGD, i think it worth every penny of it<br/><br/>The museum has a lot amount of informative matter related to Singapore history and singapore development, and also it displays the life as singaporeans <br/><br/>The building is also nice and can be a photo spot, they still keep the heritage building well maintained"

We ate from 5 different vendors - including the famous Tian Tian.  Yummy Hainanese Chicken Rice served so simple and tasty  - washed down with a beer and for me a cider.  I had amazing noodles from the stall same side as Tian back right corner (furthest from the road).  They were doing a professional photo shoot for a magazine when we visited.  Share a table with the locals - its damn hot in here, but so much fun.  I could not eat another bite of food full to the brim the two of us with multiple drinks for around $50.  Try it all - you will love it.  Can't wait to return.  Food highlight."

MVI888,595,Sep-17,Sep-17,50,Phenomenon of Singapore,"National Museum of Singapore. Located at 93 Stamford Road, I have visited many museum around the globe, Singapore National Museum has to be one of the best, if you are into history and especially the elevation of Singapore from its humble beginnings up until nowadays, and to become one of the world's prosperous country, then I would strongly suggest a visit. The National Museum gives you a great understanding of Singapore's history in a remarkable and explanatory way, from the Year 1882 to design a dedicated building for the Museum .The displays were all well-presented and easy to navigate, Artefacts are categorized by galleries according to its timeline in history, and there appeared to be good undertakings for children as well.  The highlight of the museum structure has to be the rotunda and neo-Palladian façade. While visiting Singapore and you have a free day, I Strongly recommend to pay a visit to this remarkable country, this is not an ordinary national museum it is phenomenon of Singapore."

Talk about the immense effort, design, and time the team has put in to make this place such a gem! <br/><br/>I would strongly suggest to browse through the museum's detailed website prior to visit, in order to have a better understanding on the accessibility and on-going exhibitions. Ticket price for foreign visitor is S$15. <br/><br/>We had a very thorough tour and spent almost 6 hours in the museum! We especially love the Glass Rotunda the most! Strongly recommended to pay a visit at least once even though you may not be an avid museum goer as we are, but rest assured that this is not an ordinary national museum and fun is guaranteed :)"

Spooky T,299,Sep-17,Sep-17,50,Truly a national museum about the nation's history for visitors and locals alike,"With so many quality galleries within walking distance (National Art Gallery, Singapore Art Museum, Asian Civilisations Museum, and Peranakan Museum), just why should anyone consider the National Museum of Singapore (NMS)?<br/><br/>Well, one important reason is that while the other museums and galleries provide narratives about the South East Asia and Asia, NMS is unapologetically and exclusively about the nation's narrative from the 13th to the 21st century, at least up to the passing of Lee Kuan Yew in 2015.<br/><br/>The modest size of the museum, relative to the British Museum and the national museums of many nations, suits the relatively short history of Singapore (Tumasik, Dan maxi). The galleries span three floors and are thoughtfully curated to provide a fluid narrative of the nation. If Singaporeans think they know and understand their nation's story from the history and National Education (or Character &amp; Citizenship Education) lessons in school, then they are very much mistaken. The exhibits offer intimate insights into the narratives through visual and auditory stimuli that no teacher or textbook can provide. The museum context also means that viewers are focused on engaging the themes for understanding rather than scoring in tests and examinations.<br/><br/>For visitors to Singapore, the galleries will help them better appreciate the significance of the various landmarks they visit. It is in the context of the past that the present Singapore is better understood. Otherwise, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore River, China Town, Little India, Geylang Serai, etc, are no more than tourist traps meant to bring in the tourist dollar.       <br/><br/>NMS provides a coherent visual narrative of Singapore from its days as a trading post, Crown Colony, Syonan-to, through to a modern independent city-nation. It is perhaps, at the time of this review, the only such establishment to do so.   <br/><br/>Expect to spend up to 3hours at NMS, longer if you intend to have a meal at one of its two restaurants.<br/><br/>Singaporeans and Permanent Residents enjoy free admission."

NYandAussie,355,Sep-17,Sep-17,30,Gorgeous colonial building and OK museum,"We'd done most of the big attractions in Singapore, and thought this would be an interesting hot/rainy day activity......and it did score on that aspect.  The exhibits were interesting for the most part, but it lacked a coherent ""flow"" and the animations were a tad garish and amateurish (especially in the forest exhibit).  I would have liked more of a time-line to guide us through the history of Singapore.  Maybe, I would have got more out of it if we'd been in time for the guided tour.  We did visit most of the rooms, and we it was informative.  Would recommend as a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. $15 adults, $10 for seniors (over 60)."

,,,,,,
AllanRosemary,435,Sep-17,Aug-17,50,National Museum of Singapore - a must.,"We visited here somewhat by an aside. Don't make this mistake, it was well worth the time and entry fee.<br/>You absolutely must enter the 'Story of the Forest' exhibit. OK its at first a little twee as you stroll down the winding slope and the images constantly change as you go. BUT the real deal is at the bottom (hinted at as you first enter up top), just go in, grab a beanbag if you can and lie down and be amazed. Surreal &amp; Zen cascading flowers and petals and around the base a forest grows and animals appear but its the falling flowers and petals ... magnificent and so calming. A absolute must if you are in Singapore."
,,,,,,
Rich D,730,Sep-17,Sep-17,50,Absolutely a must see for a history lover...,"A great museum to enjoy and relax away from the heat and humidity outside. A must for anybody who likes history. I am always amazed by histories of many ethnic groups, their strive to succeed and their hardships to overcome in cities around Asia. Singapore is no different with its rise to prominence as a trading port during the British rule and being built by a large influx of Malay, Chinese and Indian laborers and traders. The incoming museum sign ""We built a nation"" says it all.<br/><br/>A big part of the museum is devoted to the WWII period and the life and suffering under Syonan, the Japanese occupation from 1942-45. And even a bigger part to the political, societal, cultural and economic development of the city state post WWII and Singapore successful strive for independence in 1965 and becoming one of the richest countries in the world under the leadership of its premier minister, Lee Kuan Yew, and his PAP party. A little propaganda-ish but hard to argue with their achievements today.<br/><br/>I'm a huge sucker for old maps; coins &amp; paper money and historical posters exhibits, and there are some to enjoy.<br/><br/>Plus, Singapore, being promoted as the ""garden"" city, you must visit the audiovisual feast of flowers falling inside the glass rotunda in the modern wing of the museum. It is amazing and worth to experience it just laying down on the floor. You feel almost just like inside the movie Avatar. It's called ""The story of the forest"" and I'm pretty sure it's just a temporary exhibit. So, don't miss it;)<br/><br/>It is a little hard though not to get lost if you want to follow the exhibits chronologically. Devote at least 2 hours to enjoy it, or much more if you like to ponder over every exhibit details. <br/><br/>Recommended for kids, too... They will definitely like the Glass Rotunda exhibit."

JOSE G,289,Sep-17,Aug-17,50,A Singapore Highlight,I think National Museum of Singapore is the first visit you have to do in this city in order to understand better its history and costumes.

Grant T,703,Sep-17,Sep-17,40,A greatly improved museum,"I first visited the museum over 20 years ago and left with a distinctly disappointed memory.  Old cupboards full of dusty and dirty exhibits and... well it was just awful.  To the point that when I saw the website featuring the history of Singapore I reflected on what I had seen in the past and nearly gave it a miss.   I'M SO GLAD I WENT!<br/><br/>The museum is now something to be so proud of and I greatly enjoyed the entire experience.  There were plenty of locals and tourists here and the history of Singapore is so well worth the experience.  Make sure you leave plenty of time - at least 2 hours.  It is air-conditioned, clean, well displayed and very engaging.  There is a Seniors discount available and, I believe a discount for Students but check the website.<br/><br/>I would have no problems recommending the National Museum of Singapore.  It is GREAT"

Alex B,66,Aug-17,Aug-17,40,Interesting look at Singaporean history,"My boyfriend and I set aside around a few hours to go to the museum and enjoyed our visit. We were advised to start upstairs so we could walk down through the interactive forest section, this did make us a bit confused with the order of the information as we jumped through and skipped decades of history. I think starting on the first floor would have been better. The modern history was very interesting seeing how Singapore turned into a booming economy and the building was lovely. My only slight issues were the order we viewed the museum in and also there wasn't much interactivity in most of the sections. A good museum with lots of information but a lot of reading and not much interactivity if you take children."

FerrisXL,311,Aug-17,Aug-17,40,Museum on Singapore,"Visit to learn all about Singapore and its development from past to present. Well presented, intriguing, interesting for both kids and adults.

nzxnick,131,Aug-17,Aug-17,30,Informative history of Singapore,Spent a couple of hours here learning about the history of Singapore. There are five galleries in the main building (four upstairs and one downstairs) which cover different periods of Singapore's history. Start upstairs to go in chronological order. The basement is a kind of whole history so repeats a lot of information from the upstairs galleries.<br/><br/>My favorite sections were the gallery on the first floor (the building of modern Singapore) and a section in the basement which talks about modern Singapore.
,,,,,,
Baz L,23,Aug-17,Aug-17,40,Well worth it - but Bras Basah is nearest station ,"Me and my son found the museum fascinating, charting the island's history from early Sultan to British Colonial rule, Japanese occupation during the second world war and Lee Kuan Yew era.<br/>However the reason why doesn't get 5 stars is that, permanent residents get in for free here and unlike London where most of the museum's are free - surely this would benefit Singapore more greatly as tourists would learn about the country's history. <br/>Another point is that the museum has discretely side tracked a important part of start of the country's history in that the outbreaks of the racial riots in 1964 were some of the important contributing factors which led to the eventual separation of Singapore from the Malayan, paving the way for Singapore’s independence in June 1965."

A R H,810,Aug-17,Aug-17,30,National Childrens' Museum?,"This can not be titled a National Museum with these exhibits - very disappointing and vary un-Singaporean!  The various time period rooms were just a collection of posters skimming over events, with the WWII time frame totally distorted and uninformative.  The ground floor history gallery was a bit better, but a total maze of rooms that had me going round in circles and I'm sure I missed things as a result.  Singapore has a large amount of museums covering all sorts of subjects and periods, but visitors tend to head to the National Museum first because of the name, so why not make it a truly National Museum rather than a superficial look at the country. Singapore has such a fabulous history and culture and this needs to be housed under the National banner rather than in numerous other smaller venues."

The galleries on the second floor provided a superficial look at life in Singapore and the one on the World War II years was a particular letdown. Of more interest was the Singapore History Gallery on level one, but I found the layout of that gallery very confusing. The Flutes restaurant displayed a menu of impressive, but expensive Western dishes. Definitely not a must see, but located near Bras Basah and Dhoby Ghaut MRT stations if you go. Admission was Singapore $10 for seniors. Gift shop is on level one. Restrooms on every level."

catherinehI4470ZU,6,Aug-17,Aug-17,30,Museum a bit disappointing but lunch was great!,"Not a must see but the Flutes restaurant is well worth a visit.  The food, wine and service was excellent. The museum itself seemed to lack focus."

shinraemonsam,"1,078",Aug-17,May-17,50,Quality propaganda,"It wasn't until I read The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye that I felt it OK to express this unpopular opinion: The National Museum of Singapore is essentially a well designed, poor veiled, LKY-inspired nationalistic myth maker trying to white wash the indigenous culture of Singapore.<br/><br/>While visiting this beautiful building holding well curated exhibitions, keep in mind the suppression of civil liberties and all the opposition to this monologue who were imprisoned without trial.<br/><br/>And then enjoy The Glass Rotunda! A treat!"
,,,,,,
Thuy Mac,14,Aug-17,Jul-17,40,Impressive Exhibition,"You need to pay $10-15 to visit the museum if you're a tourist, and please queue for tickets on the right side after entering. The exhibition is well-organized with vivid pictures, videos, nice placement and even modern art performance :) On the first floor you can find activities for kids (now is children season theme) and exhibition about Singapore's history. On the second floor you can find The Glass Rotunda which leads you through one nice digital slideshow before coming back to the Historical Exhibition on the 1st floor. <br/>Bonus points: the exhibition on the 2nd floor about childhood and games has an actual game on screen for visitors .Plus,the room about nature allows you to smell the actual fragrance of some trees :D They also utilize the slideshow and interaction techniques to bring items to life in many places! <br/>They have a bit of everything, but don't set your expectation too high. This place will be more suitable to those who love cultures, history and art."

Genevieve K,306,Aug-17,Jul-17,40,A treasure,The building alone is worth a visit and just a quality collection of so many things that I can't believe you won't find something of interest.  So glad I checked it out
,,,,,,
Xin R,"1,171",Aug-17,Aug-17,50,Detailed Exhibitions,"Locals and permanent residents have free admission, while tourists have to pay $10 to $15. The Glass Rotunda on Level 2 has stunning arts exhibitions, namely the “Story of the Forest” digital installation by teamLab that brings drawings of rainforests to life, as well as the “Singapore, Very Old Tree” photography showcase by Robert Zhao that features Singaporeans’ personal stories with trees. The Glass Rotunda leads visitors down to the Singapore History Gallery on Level 1, with detailed exhibitions and an array of artefacts telling Singapore’s history. There are also other galleries in the museum. Visitors can easily spend 2 to 3 hours at the National Museum of Singapore. I recommend history buffs to visit the National Museum of Singapore and Battlebox in the same day, as they are both located in the Fort Canning area."

jbv91,294,Jul-17,Jul-17,40,Great way to learn about Singapore history,"If you're from out of the country, you'll be paying for a more expensive ticket compared to some who will get a free ticket. Overall, it's a pretty small museum (compared to other national museums I've been to), but it's a good way to walk through the timeline and changes in Singapore."
,,,,,,
Judith F,477,Jul-17,Jul-17,40,Well set out,The Museum has a number of areas and it well set out. I particularly liked seeing the old toys. Entrance is reasonable and the museum is spacious so school groups do nbot interfere with the enjoyment of the visit.

Alon264,44,Jul-17,Jul-17,40,Very Interesting,"A great way to spend the morning . We had a fantastic guide who really knew her history and made the tour a fun way to learn about the history of Singapore , it is well worth visiting the museum."
,,,,,,
Mukta2016,481,Jul-17,Jun-17,50,A Very Good Museum,The National Museum of Singapore is one of the top class museums that I have visited. The museum does a very good job of portraying the history of Singapore and also has a lot of information on present day Singapore. Definitely worth visiting if one wants to make the most of visit to Singapore.
,,,,,,
The_Coach55,660,Jul-17,Jul-17,50,Very Good Displays of Local and Natural History,"The museum is situated in Stamford Street and is just over the road from Bras Basah MRT station.<br/><br/>There was a nice display of local flora and fauna in the Glass Rotunda, but I was more interested in the pictures of trees taken in various spots throughout the island and their significance to the local community.<br/><br/>I enjoyed very much the displays relating to the period just before the Second World War, the Japanese Occupation and its aftermath, and the time before and after the creation of the independent state of Singapore.<br/><br/>There was a recreation of the drive in movie park that was very popular in the Seventies and the footage of the legendary Cleopatra Wong was a delight to behold.<br/><br/>I spent a good three hours looking around and the admission fee was SIN$15."

Pacificwoman59,332,Jul-17,Jul-17,50,Well worth visiting,The National Museum of Singapore gives you a great understanding of Singapore's history in an interesting and informative way. The displays were all well presented and easy to navigate and there appeared to be good activities for children as well. Don't miss the Story of the Forest in the glass rotunda.

Lavy10,351,Jul-17,Jul-17,40,Only for people interested in Singapore history,It gives lot of information about the history of Singapore. From the time of their first king to British colonisation and Independence.<br/>   It has refreshment zone too
,,,,,,
swissami19,505,Jul-17,Jul-17,50,Good overview,"We spent a couple of hours in the museum focusing on the Singapore parts. The exhibit on the ground level was very well done, interesting and entertaining. On the upper floor we spent some time in the ""living in Singapore section"", and found this to be very informative, too.<br/><br/>Don't forget to go to the ""battlebox"", about 5 minutes away."

Fred B,16,Jul-17,Jul-17,40,Excellent overview of the history of Singapore,We did not have time to visit all the exhibitions but spent our time in the main exhibition - the history of Singapore. Very well laid out with an impressive amount of facts presented in different ways. Been to Singapore many times but learned so much in a few hours. The Cafe is also very pleasant.
,,,,,,
Michal R,391,Jul-17,Jul-17,40,Informative and well presented,Being a self confessed museum junkie I just had to visit it and was not disappointed.  The exhibition about the history of Singapore was well laid out and informative.  Children activities were interesting and well thought out.

charlie_dog,"1,156",Jul-17,Jul-17,30,Building was the best bit ,Felt this place wasn't much of an actual museum they have a 3 D type room which is relaxing. Only go if it's raining there are better things to do in Singapore.  <br/>Loved the architecture.
,,,,,,
Chandni S,41,Jul-17,Dec-16,50,One of the best museums I have visited ,"The museum ticket is a little heavy on your pocket but definitely worth it. It is very well organised and easy to browse through. Each section of the museum is very well displayed and their short movies on various topics are very interesting. You can easily spend 3-4 hours here. The Singapore history and its rise as a finance hub is demonstrated extremely well. By the end of it, you will fall in love with Singapore much more."

OzTravel_12,16,Jul-17,Jan-17,50,Awesome galleries and restaurants to relax,Went with my mum who is 72 but very mobile. We spent 6 hours looking at galleries or enjoying a coffee.

coffeenut64,745,Jul-17,Jul-17,50,Brilliant display,"I spent hours here, taking in the history of Singapore from its earliest inception to current times.<br/>Beatifully set out,  meticulous in detail, it is one of the best things I have done in Singapore, and leaves you with a sense of how Singapore developed the pride it justifiably has in itself.<br/>A must visit for locals and visitors."
,,,,,,

JMart2013,363,Jul-17,Jul-17,50,Family fun at NMS,"My husband, 2 year old daughter and I visited here on our first day in Singapore and would definitely recommend it. Entry is $15 but there are currently 2 pop up children's areas which were very good for our daughter. The section on the history of Singapore was extremely informative and both my husband and I learned quite a lot. <br/>Our daughter had lunch in the cafe and the food was good. All in all well worth a visit."

Ann_CatherineNorway,322,Jul-17,Jul-17,50,Very good!,"As far as museums go, this is a gem. The presentation of the history of Singapore is actually very interesting. And there is the Flower Dome! Truly special experience. Highly recommended."

jerbysanto,45,Jul-17,Aug-16,50,SEA's repository of the arts,"Very extensive museum in terms of showcasing the arts of the region. I saw paintings of Philippine art luminaries like Damian Domingo, Juan Luna, BenCab, Amorsola, Anita Magsaysay Ho, Malang, Botong Francisco etc, all in one place. The museum traces the development of visual arts in the ASEAN. Really, really worth the effort, time and money.<br/>If you are into the arts, I advice you to give the place a day or even two to explore."

RafikiLondon,494,Jul-17,Jul-17,50,Excellent Museum,Great collection and good diverse and factual content. Kids spaces and brilliant art installation. I could go back and get more out of it.

Dallas C,57,Jul-17,Jul-17,30,The exhibits on the first floor were interesting,I found the exhibits on the ground floor to be boring. You can only see so many pieces of broken china and look at so many paintings. The exhibit on the first floor however were interesting. I enjoyed looking back at life in Singapore in the 1920' s-until 1970's. That was worth the price of admission.
,,,,,,
Jenny H,42,Jul-17,Jul-17,50,Wonderful experience!!,"We had a very special experience at this Museum.  The history of Singapore exhibits were excellent - interesting and well presented. Top of the day (and our whole week in Singapore) was The World of the Forest. Wow!  This light, sound and smell experience catered to all the senses with falling opening flowers from the dome that you could smell, accompanied by beautiful music and birdsounds.  Such an all encompassing experience we had to go through twice and spent a long time on the beanbags watching the images of animals (taken from colonial drawings) change and interact in the ""Forest"". Just unbelievable - don't miss it."

2016Chua,196,Jul-17,Jul-17,20,Nice building needs more contents,"It is a nice architecture building worth for photography.  I visited the Singapore history section, good information but found the lighting on the exhibits were too dimmed and difficult to read the texts.  Ratio of eating places versus exhibits seem a little high as compared to other museums."

Thursday41,43,Jul-17,Feb-17,50,Great exhibition,i didn't know what to expect from this visit but I was blown away by the quality of the artworks. The conceptual works were far above those I have seen elsewhere and those demanding  a more craft based side were excellent.

Jane A,45,Jul-17,Jun-17,40,Great museum in a great building,We spent a good 2.5 hours pottering around this museum and still didn't see it all. Lots about pre and post WWII Singapore.

Kane H,13,Jul-17,Jun-17,30,Good for the history buff,Maybe a little boring for very young child. But the food was good and it was great to learn some of the history of Singapore.
,,,,,,
deltahater,202,Jul-17,Jul-17,40,Bigger than it looks,"Kind of like Singapore itself, its small but packs a punch. Singapore only has 200 years or so of history, but they manage to fill a ton of rooms with facts and figures. They also have (currently) a ""Life to Tree"" exhibition that is bascially a psychodelic light show. Very bizarre. But toddlers seem to like it.<br/>I would budget at least 2-3 hours for this."
,,,,,,
885Jan885,74,Jul-17,Jun-17,50,If you want to learn history of Singapore visit this,I enjoyed my visit to the museum since I am keen to learn about singapore history. They present it well. Try to join the guided tour which is free. Guide will explain minor details of the exhibits which is very interesting. There are Lee Kuan Yew's speeches gallery and one can spend  whole day listening to this great leader.
,,,,,,
HMChau,45,Jul-17,Jul-17,40,I wish I was given a warning on closing time of certain galleries,"A very interactive, creative,innovative museum. You can spend a good 4 hours there and still missed the chance to visit some galleries that closed at 6:15pm instead of the normal 7pm. The outdoor terrace cafe is very beautiful but also closed  by 7pm"
,,,,,,
FlyWithKids,257,Jul-17,Jul-17,50,Great Museum,"Great museum, we got to experience art, technology, history and current data on Singapore all in 2 hours. <br/>Very good museum for both kids and adults.  <br/>We had no line to buy tickets, so that was pleasant. <br/>The glass center on the 4th level has a technology exhibition with forest as a theme that was truly magical to experience.  <br/>They have kids season at the moment, so there were a couple of extra children's sections that explained all the different ""worlds"" that come together in Singapore. <br/>The history section was very well presented.  Many different kinds of exhibits made the visit interesting and dynamic."

andrearobbiebebop,105,Jul-17,Jun-17,40,A great general overview of Singapore,"We visited he National Museum on the first day of our stay, and found it to be a very enjoyable and interesting start to our holiday, giving us a good general overview of the history of Singapore and its development over the past couple of hundred years.  We would recommend this as a good start for anyone exploring Singapore for the first time."

AHM73,203,Jul-17,Jul-17,50,Brilliant experience ,"We took a group of 9 (4xA &amp; 5xC) and found this had something for everyone. The building alone is stunning, but the displays inside are fantastic. Learnt so much about the early days of Singapore and the years of Japanese occupation. All done in a way that is not confrontational for children but detailed enough to educate. The pictures from old Singapore were probably my highlight. Spent a solid 4 hours in here and loved it."
,,,,,,
John E,47,Jul-17,Jul-17,40,"So informative, relaxed and insightful","We found the refreshing strategies used to convey the story of Singapore very colourful and easy to follow. They are justly proud of their achievements, their inclusive society and anxious to share their goals and experiences of their journey in a way that is appealing to all ages.  It was a great day and their use of the space excellent. Staff very helpful"

Professionalwanderer,52,Jul-17,Jun-17,50,"A great explanation of the ""Singapore Story""","Singapore's history - for such a small place in world terms - is remarkably varied. From the Malay princes through to Chinese traders, Indian migrants, Stamford Raffles, two World Wars, a brief union with Malaysia and the shiny modern metropolis of today, there's a lot to take in. Thankfully, the National Museum does a very good job of this.<br/><br/>The main gallery is the absolute key here. It starts with pre-history and gradually steps the visitor through every important piece of the story, with good amounts of focus on the key players - Raffles, of course, but also figures of high local importance like Tan Tock Seng and Omar al-Junied, who perhaps aren't as well-known outside of the island.<br/>As well as the customary collection of exhibits behind glass, there are also some audio-visual elements, including a rather over-acted video detailing Raffles' machinations in claiming Singapore for London, and some reminiscences of locals describing the smell of the Singapore River in the 1960s (one of these is delivered in very thick Singlish, and could almost benefit from a translation).<br/><br/>The split from Malaysia is described - naturally from the Singaporean side of that dispute - and this time around I even saw the original television appearance of the teary Lee Kuan Yew announcing that momentous piece of news, which I didn't remember from a previous visit.<br/><br/>There are a couple of other significant museums to visit elsewhere in Singapore - the various Heritage Centres for the three major ethnic groups provide very important pieces of the story as well - but this should be on everyone's itinerary if they're interested in understanding the whys and wherefores of this remarkable little country."
,,,,,,
Wendy H,369,Jul-17,Jun-17,50,A most professional history museum,The story of Singapore unfolds as you walk through the dimly lit National Museum.  Like many museums it is a quiet place but is filled with information and displays on the many people who have contributed to making Singapore what it is today.  travelling in time from the early settlers and the eventual British involvement gives a good understanding of how Singapore has become the multi-cultural hub it is today.  <br/>The building itself is exceptionally well maintained and provides a glimpse of colonial times.<br/>There is an entry fee but don't be put off by this - the experience is well worth the cost.<br/>The forest display is another not to miss.  the domed theatre is used to project images of thousands of flowers falling with occasional comets passing through.  Certainly one your children would love almost as much as you will.<br/>I would personally give the museum restaurant a miss as service is incredibly slow and staff could be described as disinterested at best.  <br/>When you finish take a walk through the nearby Fort Canning Park for more history and some great gardens (again give the food here a miss)
,,,,,,
NauticalDreamer3010,512,Jul-17,Jun-17,40,A must for those interested in history,We only spent a couple of hours here and managed to get on to one of the free tours.  The one hour tour gave us an excellent understanding of the fascinating history of the area. The many interactive exhibits tell the story in a way that will hold the interest of even those with only a modest interest in the history of Singapore and its people.

Stylstnz,77,Jul-17,Jun-17,50,History lesson.,I enjoyed my visit to the Museum.   The displays are modern and fun and provide an easy way to learn about the history of Singapore.
,,,,,,
Kor M,170,Jul-17,Jun-17,40,"History Gallery, Surviving Syonan are the best parts","The most interesting and informative part of the museum is the Singapore History Gallery, whose nature is fairly self-explanatory. The Gallery presents a very good trail from the very beginnings of Singapore through its development as a British colony, through to the modern era. The exhibits are well-presented and educational, and we can thoroughly recommend the one hour guided tour (ours began at 11:00 a.m. but call for other times). Coming a close second to the History Gallery is the 'Surviving Syonan' exhibit on the second floor, which illustrates what life was like under the Japanese occupation of 1942-45. The other exhibits on the second floor such as 'Growing Up' and 'Modern Colony' are far less interesting and could easily be skipped by those facing time pressure."
,,,,,,
IAHGVA,443,Jun-17,Jul-17,50,Awesome architecture and great exhibitions ,"If only just for the amazing architectural feat that is the refurbishment and conversion of these two former British colonial time buildings into a museum, it is a must-see. On top of that it features world-class exhibitions, I personally went to see Yayoi Kusama and Singapore efficiency made it a very pleasant visit, despite the crowds, thanks to the timed entry concept. Don't miss it even if you are normally not into museums. The roof garden, walking around the library dome, the bridge linking the top floors, all quite extraordinary if you think that they were two separate official buildings a couple of years ago. A bit reminiscent, concept-wise, of the British Museum."
,,,,,,
Benedict Hunjan,320,Jun-17,Jun-17,50,Really worthwhile and insightful.,A thoroughly brilliant museum - inside and out. We spent the last two hours before closing quickly whipping around the exhibitions which are brilliant - the right level of detail and very professionally presented. I feel so much more informed on the history of Singapore now. The rotunda was also mesmerising - not to be missed. Definitely do this if visiting Singapore.

ronp1954,631,Jun-17,Jun-17,50,Great history lesson of Singapore,"Raining outside do the museum was a good place to visit. It is quite a large museum with much to see so very glad we took advantage of s guided tour (no extra charge). The gentleman who took the tour was a very pleasant person with a very good knowledge of Singapores history. We learnt so much about Singapore that we were never new, much more than we learnt at school or from history books, it was a great experience. Highly recommend the museum and taking the tour with a guide."

radostina s,179,Jun-17,Jun-17,50,Start your Singapore trip with this museum ,The main building is in colonial style. The modern part of the museum is wrapped around the old one and create a stunning combination of modern and traditional. It's an excellent way to start discovering Singapore as it has a very detailed exhibition on the country's history. <br/>The entry fee is S$15 for adults and includes all exhibitions. It's open everyday from 10 to 19h. Last entry at 18:30. <br/>Enjoy !

JKT1949,53,Jun-17,Jun-17,50,So much fun for the whole family,"We went to learn the history of Singapore and came out with much more enriched experience than we expected. It is a place ideal for the whole family. there are areas for the kids to explore, to sense, to touch, to play and to learn. There are IMAX experience to see the flowers, there are bitter past history with present vigorous growing path. Singapore is one of the four most fast growing countries in Asia. With all the high rises around the city and fast paced life, I can feel the heart beat of this city through the visit of the museum."

Christopher E,324,Jun-17,May-17,50,So much to see!,"Like so many museums, the National Museum of Singapore is vast with so much to see. We spent a good half day in the museum and barely scratched the surface of all the exhibits available. It is absolutely fascinating and we took advantage of a guided tour (free)  to ensure that we saw some of themore important parts of the museum. Highly recommended especially when it's wet outside! There is an entry charge but seniors (over 60's) get a discount!"

GDay1044,"1,061",Jun-17,Jun-17,50,Worth more than 5 stars,"Museums are boring? - When I think of museums my mind usually pictures rows of dusty exhibits in long cold silent halls well not so in this wonderful place – this museum is a living tribute to Singapore from its early beginnings under Malay Sultans 700 years ago, then a Crown Colony, Japanese occupation in the 1940’s and post war struggles to the great Independent country it is today. There are a number of specific theme Galleries on the top floor with static displays, Video’s and Sound bites presented in a vibrant and interesting manner – enter the Story of the Forest at the top of the Rotunda and be amazed at the audio digital presentations in the entrance room and as you descend a circular ramp against the wall there is another digital masterpiece of a living forest depicting animated William Farquhar natural history drawings – the finale is a darkened dome illuminated by a kaleidoscope of colors as a forest grows around you – stunning – this leads into a comprehensive exhibition concentrating on Singapore life over the past 100 years – entrance was S$15 for adults with a concession for seniors over 60 at S$10 – worth every cent – you need quite a lot of time to enjoy it all – there is a pleasant restaurant for you to take a break – if this is not on your to do list it should be."
,,,,,,
Kong_Ming,24,Jun-17,Jun-17,40,A Good Family Excursion,"Brought the kids here to know more about our own history. The Museum provides a positive experience to tour the exhibits, which were nicely done up, in tasteful displays. Informative and good learning experience for the children as well. It is free for Singaporeans, which makes it even more of waste for Singaporeans who did not make this trip."

Sharon T,111,Jun-17,Jun-17,50,Singapore's history,Each time I visit Singapore the first place I go to is the National Museum to see the changes in their exhibits.  It was during school holidays this time when I visited and I was not disappointed as there was an exhibition showing 100 years of history and I was in my element to read through as much as I could on its history through the years in different exhibits such as 1920s - 1930 - 1940s the 1950 - 1970s a time when I remember visiting Singapore for the first time in 1973; how different Singapore was back then and to see the photographs of that era brought back many happy memories.  For children there was an exhibition on 'the animated forest' filled with colour and wonder to young eyes and to older eyes as well; the digital animation brought to life animals of the forest much to the delight of the children who were there enjoying the changes of scenery as much as I was.  Singapore's National Museum is a must for visiting especially for those who love history.  Unfortunately for me I did not have enough time to spend there as I like too; there is so much to absorb.

Pa E,177,Jun-17,Jan-17,50,Singapore's oldest museum,Explored the museum during January 2017. It is a splendid layout that boasted high visual impact.  Spent few hours exploring each level and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Definitely a good soothing experience.

driller52,105,Jun-17,May-17,40,Down memory Lane,I spent a few years of my childhood in Malaysia. This museum provided memories of my arrival and the cultural shock of a child in leaving Australia to live in Asia. The explanation of Independence was great and something I did not know. Also the more human stories of the Japanese occupation were done really well. I really enjoyed this museum.

m_star88,44,Jun-17,Aug-16,50,Learn the History and Culture of Singapore,"This is an amazing place to learn about the history and culture of Singapore. Housed in a historic building itself, the National Museum of Singapore also hosts other exhibits that are worth seeing. There are guided tours that you can avail at the entrance when you buy the ticket, or you can also just walk along and read the inscriptions."
,,,,,,
MillionMiler17,278,Jun-17,Jan-17,50,Fascinating education on the history of Singapore!!,I thought I would spend 1 or 2 hours in the Museum and ended up spending almost 5 hours going through the exhibits. Its very well laid out and very interesting. The exhibits might be a little much for kids as it does take a lot of reading and almost no interactive exhibits. There are free tours for the first part of the exhibits which are well worth listening to. The building is also beautiful which adds to the experience. There is also a nice cafe there for refreshments or break during the exhibits.

rashig,144,Jun-17,May-17,40,"Good visit, slightly off the beaten tourist path","Visiting the National Museum during children's season. They have a variety of fun, educational activities for children. And a giant trampoline at the entrance. Better to send children here alone else the wait is longer. All in all, 1-2 hours spent here is well spent."
,,,,,,
Ethel_Sha,250,Jun-17,Jun-17,50,"Not only for history learning, but also aesthetic appreciation","They are now having an exhibition designed by a Japanese firm, teamLab, in the glass rotunda, which is STUNNING! You will experience a spiral down path with a view of forrest, which leads you down to a small room to experience a ""shower of flowers"" by lying down on the floor. This is a time limited exhibition, so do check it out.<br/>And you will also see bottles of different plants found in Fort Canning Park, which is next to the museum. The room with these bottle is also beautiful. Shelves were made of concrete blocks and there are sufficient bottles for visitors to smell. Staff there were also very helpful! And you will have a long walk of history about Singapore, which is so detailed not only its history, but also their ways of presentation.<br/>As it is now Children's season, children can also experience and learn in the museum! It is much appreciated!<br/>There is fine dining option, and casual dining. We chose the casual one and tried their Laksa Egg Benedict, which is a fun to try. It worths a visit!"

Exhibits and galleries were presented in many interesting ways that demonstrate how Singapore developed.  Material is more adult in nature but enough exhibits for children to keep them interested.  Easy to reach by public transit.

Yoniverse,57,May-17,May-17,50,Make this your first stop!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the National Museum. I spent a total of 6.5 hours there! I enjoyed every bit of it, everything I learned and everything I wished I had more time to carefully read. The exhibition is really well curated and the museum very well taken care of. The only suggestion I have is to add more seats throughout the galleries. I was standing so much that I simply had to rush through the ""Singapore Lifestyle"" galleries because of the back pain. Please add more seats, especially next to the audio story booths."

Schaper-Lim,438,May-17,May-17,50,Highlight of the trip,"A renovated City Hall and Supreme Court which also houses the Declaration of Independence among lots of local paintings. Set aside 3 hrs for it, could have taken more. What a restoration. Take train to City Hall and a short stroll (under cover) from there. For Singaporean, pre-booked ticket online. Visitors get discount if can present KrisFlyer (Singapore airline) frequent flyer."

Neith293,28,May-17,Oct-16,40,Educational exhibits,"There are main exhibits that remains the same throughout the year, but special exhibits with different themes are always being put up.

Shan J,11,May-17,Mar-17,50,State-of-the-art,"Frequent exhibitions are held here. If you are travelling during some festivals like Singapore Night Festival or Art Festival, special events may be held inside and outside the museum. It's located downtown and the trip to the museum is quite easy. Just cross two streets, there is Singapore Art Museum. If you like spending time in museums, Singapore is the right place to come."

globetrottingourmand,"1,409",May-17,Sep-16,40,Surprisingly well curated,"I went for an exhibition and professor talk which was really well organised and had a houseful. After the exhibition, I got a chance to have a look at the exhibits which were very well curated. I think the museum isn't well-known enough and not popular yet due to limited information and tourist visitors but is now gaining popularity. Spotless clean, amazing staff and amazing artefacts."

Nick D,"1,241",May-17,Mar-17,50,do this one first,"such a well done museum (as are some of the other ones) but this puts a lot of the history into context.  We spent over 5 hours here.  We learned so much about the times before the British, the British, the Malay states, why Singapore left the Malay states, and how the have accomplished the economic miracle that is today's Singapore.  <br/>There was a free tour available as well - which we took - that was well done and very informative.<br/>My only negative comment is that an audio guide would be good."

Ehatlestad,109,May-17,May-17,40,Interesting history of Singapore,"The museum has a great location, and is a nice building. The history given of Singapore is very well told with a lot of nice artifacts. 15$ entry is not too bad. <br/> Not too crowded. Have some dining options with coffee and light food at reasonable prices. All in all worth a visit.<br/>We went to the National Museum, and then to the battle box on Fort Canning for a guided tour."

VagabondGuru,8,May-17,Apr-17,40,Awesome job of capturing the history of Singapore !,"We had kept only an hour or so for this place but trust me there is enough to keep you occupied for at least half a day here. Especially if you are one of those who take interest in the history of a place. I guess most seasoned travelers are and the thorough job they have done here needs to be appreciated.<br/><br/>Right from a maritime chart that shows Simha pura (Original Sanskrit name of Singapore) on the ancient sea lanes to capturing the lifestyle of the Chettiars from South India who shaped the financial business, you will find a wealth of minor details that help you understand modern Singapore.<br/><br/>They have used a combination of different media - Interesting audio visuals that are mapped onto sprawling screens, recreated interiors of a house and collection of World War II memorabilia - suffice it to say that they have succeeded in transporting you through the journey Singapore has made to evolve as a favourite hub of modern  international commerce.<br/><br/>Housed in an elegant building, there is even a restaurant here so that you can stay on if you desire to.<br/><br/>If you are not one of those history buffs, you can breeze through in about 30 minutes  as there are only 4 large halls that need to be traversed."

Arabella K,159,May-17,May-17,50,The changed exhibit is wonderful,"We went to the National Museum of Singapore for my husband's birthday.  We thought it would be the same as when we saw it years ago.  We were pleasantly surprised that they changed most of the exhibit.  The museum still has an interesting way to showcase how Singapore became independent, however, it also now gives a fabulous fanciful highlight of Singapore's natural landscape.  We absolutely loved our experience there."
,,,,,,
Tony Y,14,May-17,May-17,40,Great place to learn about the history of Singapore ,It was 15 dollars for non Singaporeans and 10 if you are a student. I enjoyed my stay there but the content was quite limited. However I definitely think it's worth the entrance fees and a nice stop to visit during the hot summer tines as a break from all the outdoor tourist attractions.

Craig L,99,May-17,May-17,50,Worth a History Lesson,I had some time to kill and decided to visit the museum. One could spend hours here with a well thought out layout of scenes and history of Singapore. I was quite surprised by the quality of the exhibits and the most descriptive commentary. Some interesting facts were gleaned by my visit and i would encourage those with an inclination to understand cities they visit. It is a sleeper but if you have the time and patience you will not be disappointed.

MM0311,278,May-17,Dec-16,50,Great insight into Singapores history ,"This museum offers a detailed and informative insight into how Singapore became the glorious city it is today! It tells you the number of invasions the city has dealt with, how the government dealt with public infrastructure problems, the housing system, the varieties of ethnicities that have made Singapore their home and many other things I do not remember.

Detailed displays recounting the history of Singapore.

Could have gone through again but time did not allow."

Taylablake,128,Apr-17,Apr-17,20,Boring and basic,We usually love museums. But this was boring and basic! Firstly you line up to buy a ticket but you can not see the prices until you get to the desk. This wastes people time as no one is prepared. They layout is not great. You enter the first level and follow that floor plan around then you go upstairs to the second level only to end up back on the first floor in the first exhibition you started with and then you have to re exit that one and go back upstairs to continue. If you knew about this you would start right at the top and work your way down. <br/>Personally we learnt and appreciated more of Singapore history at our tourist attractions.<br/><br/>What was great was the architecture of the building. Stunning! That gets 10/10! <br/><br/>The cafe there was ridiculous. We waiting for 15 minutes at our table and got ignored so we decided to get up and order. Only to be told we had to sit down for our order to be taken. So we sat down for a further 15 minutes. Didn't get served so we left.<br/><br/>If you had children you will be very sorry you take them here! They will be bored to death

murali8121,794,Apr-17,Apr-17,40,National museum of Singapore ,Gives you a great insight into how Singapore came into and what all went through in the past centuries and how they achieved the present day status. There was a one hour guided tour at 11:00 which was very interesting and informative. There is so much to see and the best way would be to go on a guided tour first and then go back to see in detail and also go through the galleries and glass rotunda that are not covered in the tour. You can spend around three hours here. There is a restaurant to take a break in between.
,,,,,,
Penguin2501,16,Apr-17,Apr-17,50,Loved it,"Had a fantastic guide (guided tours are free)...she spoke of the building's history when it was the Supreme Court.

It covers very local as well as whole of Asia themes and does it very well. We spent most of the morning there but were planning to leave to have lunch somewhere. What a mistake that would have been! The cafe on site was excellent and there was an upscale lunch and dinner venue as well if that suits you. What an excellent visit we had and if you have a couple of young ones in tow, they may just enjoy it..."

We are glad we waited an hour to do our own walking before joining

gingerlee13,456,Apr-17,Feb-17,50,Great history museum in Singapore,I always enjoy visiting the National Museum in Singapore.  There is usually an interesting special exhibit going on as well as the excellent permanent galleries.  An especially interesting gallery is the one that tells the story of the Japanese occupation during World War II.  There are other interesting looks at popular culture and social life during both the colonial era and the evolution of Singapore since independence.  This museum is definitely worth spending several hours of your day.

Zoe S,47,Apr-17,Apr-17,30,Well presented but not much content,"The museum is in a spectacular building and the displays are well layed out and well explained as you'd exoect from a modern museum.

Lauren S,29,Mar-17,Mar-17,50,Fantastic Intro to Singapore,"We went on the free guided tour, which was given by a French lady. She clearly had a practiced routine, but was also able to answer questions off the cuff, so that was great. The museum exhibits though are also fine to explore at your own pace without a guide, as the signage is pretty extensive and informative. <br/><br/>Point of information- if you're going straight from Battlebox to here, you can enter the museum by the back entrance as you come down the hill from Battlebox. Just remember to go to the front to purchase a ticket."

Jean-Luc D,141,Mar-17,Mar-17,40,Learning about Singapore,"If ever you want to learn about the Historical path and the civilisation of Singapore, this is the museum you have to visit. Buildings are well renovated and you can enjoy extra expositions. So not hesitate, you will learn something."

ViaBen,731,Mar-17,Feb-17,40,Learn about Singapore,"Big modern and interesting museum that cover the relatively short history of the country from the age of trading villages, to the Portuguese and Dutch merchants, to the British Empire, to the struggle for independence until the present day.<br/>Great displays of everyday items, photos, maps, paintings with a strong emphasis on the contribution that the three main ethnic groups have made to Singapore.<br/>The galleries displaying the more recent history are particularly interesting as they show all the effort and struggle that went into creating contemporary Singapore (and also the effort in projecting a totally positive image of a country with no problems at all....)."

Frank S,305,Mar-17,Sep-16,50,Excellent Museum highlighting Singapore's history,"The National Museum of Singapore provides an in-depth look at Singapore's history, starting with its fishing village origins, to the modern, wealthy state it is today. <br/><br/>The 1st floor houses the ""Singapore History Gallery"" and the 2nd floor has smaller galleries based around ""Life in Singapore""."

David N,"1,300",Mar-17,Mar-17,40,Interesting museum,We visited the National Museum recently during our time in Singapore and were lucky to attend on a day when the additional exhibits on display were nearing the end of their display period so our viewing was free. The museum itself has a wide range of art history and some lovely displays that delve into Singapore's past.
,,,,,,
Paige W,23,Mar-17,Aug-16,40,"Affordable, Informative, Fun!","The museum is inexpensive and incredibly extensive. Students (even foreign students) can receive a discount by showing student ID cards. This attraction is very affordable. <br/><br/>Besides the affordability, it is beyond worth the money. I learned an incredible amount about Singapore's history and easily spent 3 hours there and didn't see nearly everything. Some exhibits are interactive making this an option for those travelling with children too. Anyone who enjoys history will love this attraction as it portrays the history of Singapore through written information plaques, tangible objects, photographs, and engaging exhibits!"

Green Dragonfly Girl,101,Mar-17,Mar-17,50,A great place to vsiit,A wonderful experience with some really interesting exhibits. The building in itself is really lovely.

Anna R,571,Mar-17,Mar-17,40,Not only for history buffs,"The building itself is a landmark: the first purpose-built museum in Queen Victoria's times.  Free guided tours (1 hr, very informative and entertaining) are available at 11 am and 2 pm, and 20% discount applies if you show your Singapore Airlines boarding pass.  A great place to learn about the fascinating history of Singapore.<br/>Upstairs, I  also saw something completely different - and kids would love it: a high-tech, animated interactive display called 'Birth of the Forest"" - best enjoyed lying on the  comfortable bean bags provided and watching the show on the ceiling."

geographyguy_11,510,Mar-17,Mar-17,30,Good as an introduction,"The National Museum of Singapore offers a comprehensive overview of Singapore's history from the establishment of the very first fishing village by a passing King to the post-independence development and industrialization. However, unless you visit this as soon as possible during your Singapore holiday, you will find it a tad boring. I didn't get here till me last day and having already been to the Former Ford Factory, Battle Box, Changi Museum, Singapore City Gallery, Arts House at Old Parliament, Chinatown Heritage Centre, Peranakan Museum and many others, I found that the National Museum was repeating what I had already seen. The smaller Life in Singapore Galleries on the 2nd floor did not add much to the main (and extremely well-presented) Singapore History Gallery on the ground floor. The Glass Rotunda displays a Disney-style little kids magic forest with zero connection to Singapore. The National Museum is undoubtedly a good museum, but I found visiting individual attractions made for a more enjoyable experience."
,,,,,,
Chris Q,46,Mar-17,Mar-17,40,Really enjoyable experience  worth a visit,"Just the architect and seeing this building is great , but enjoying the paintings and exhibitions was wonderful , modern air conditioned  , large well versed staff everywhere to assist you"

cobbdouglas,90,Mar-17,Mar-17,40,Only place that showcases the history of Singapore,"I was very interested in how Singapore became the global city that it is today, given that  around 50 years ago it was a third-world country. I found the displays informative, and they also include some audio recordings of actual people who were the first few residents of HDBs (very interesting!). However, I found the first few parts of the exhibit confusing--I knew nothing about Singapore/Malaysia geography and so found the displays hard to follow.<br/><br/>Overall though, I recommend it. I just wish they had a better layout, and more information about life from 1965-present."
,,,,,,
TabernashColorado,136,Mar-17,Mar-17,50,Well done museum,"The museum does a good job with the cultural history of Singapore.  Don't expect much on natural history.  Could be better on the pre-British eras, but definitely worth the time."
,,,,,,
mikmik09,59,Mar-17,Sep-16,50,"Past, Present, and the Future of Singapore",I spent like 4 hours in here because the museum has installed a detailed exhibition of its rich history as a young island city-state-- from its humble beginnings up to the challenges of the present and future plans. You will appreciate every effort made in each gallery to showcase to the world what Singapore has achieved.
,,,,,,
Chris S,520,Mar-17,Mar-17,50,Like so much of Singapore carried out to a very high standard,This is yet another place in Singapore that is well worth a visit - took us 3.5 hours as there was so much to take in. Very good value for money and something for all ages

James M,109,Mar-17,Feb-17,40,Very cool - worth doing,"Great history and interesting exhibits.  The building itself is quite lovely, and they have several options for dining.  The day we were there they also had a free concert of a string quartet in the lobby which was lovely.  Nice place to visit in Singapore"

lextalion,27,Mar-17,Dec-16,40,Visit to get historical background,Very large and only managed to visit one floor which took 3 hours to cover. Many interesting exhibits but few places to sit and rest so probably not for those who have difficulty in walking.<br/>Ecellent cafe which is inexpensive by local standards. A short walk from the MTR station

Daringlunchmeat,178,Mar-17,Mar-17,50,Singapore's rich history,"I came to the museum on a Friday morning in March and it wasn't too crowded, so it was easy to see and read about everything. If you are a Singaporean resident, admission is free, which is awesome. My admission price was S$15. The Singapore History Gallery is a thoughtful, well described and curated walk through the history of the country from Singapura all the way to Singapore as it is now. It was incredibly educational and fascinating. From rickshaw coolies, to secret societies, through the British Crown Colony, Japanese invasion, up to economic prosperity, there is so much to learn about this small but diverse nation. <br/><br/>In the glass rotunda I explored the installation ""Story of the Forest"" which was an immersive, colorful view of life in a forest including a dark room where you can lay on the floor and watch flowers open and fall down along with shooting stars and a neon forest with pink deer. It was oddly relaxing. Afterwards there was Singapore, Very Old Tree, which is an installation of photos in light boxes of people with their favorite trees, inspired by an old post card that simply read ""Singapore, Very Old Tree."" It was really nice and the trees were incredible, along with the stories behind them. <br/><br/>I highly recommend a stop here for at least an hour just to get a better feel for how Singapore got to this place now and more insight into how they became such a diverse country."

Rasmus J,155,Mar-17,Feb-17,40,Nice little walk through of Singapore history,Nicely divided up in timeline segments. Holding several interesting stores form each period. The olde building have just been renovated to perfection. Beautiful and educating.

Irwin Arribas,55,Mar-17,Mar-17,40,An afternoon at the Museum ,"The National Museum could use some face lifting in terms of its exhibits, since it focused more on the events around World War 2 and thereafter.<br/>Present day Singapore should be given ample exhibit space.<br/>I love their Sight and Sound parts."
,,,,,,
Scott R,3,Mar-17,Mar-17,40,Nice way to learn about Singapore,Easy to get through in a couple of hours and get a nice overview of the history of Singapore.  The information was well presented.  Was looking for something to do while staying over a weekend on business and this hit the mark.

Y0rkshire_Travellers,105,Mar-17,Feb-17,40,Well worth a visit if you have some extra time in Singapore,We were on a back to back cruise in Singapore and had a few hours until we had to get back to the ship. We went the museum because of all the good reviews. It was very expensive and decided to go anyway. We had a one hour tour with an English speaking guide who was very good even though English was her second language. There was a very large group of children visiting the museum which made hearing the guide very difficult but she did try her best. If you have a few hours and want to get out of the heat this is a good place to visit.
,,,,,,
Jasmine L,305,Mar-17,Mar-17,40,Beautifully Renovated,Great place to wander through- plenty of free areas to learn about the heritage of the building. Smoke and Mirrors on the rooftop has a phenomenal view of Singapore

midmag,49,Mar-17,Feb-17,50,Excellent,"Very good museum, there are tour guides on the hour that last an hour. Our guide was excellent taking us through the history of Singapore from its beginnings until present day. Fascinating and very informative especially the Second World War period with the Japanese invasion and the struggle for independence. Well worth a vusit"

Trenham Ian Weatherhead,526,Mar-17,Feb-17,50,A museum of national importance,"I first came to the Museum back in 1972! However it has undergone major renovations back in 2006 and fortunately is within walking distance of Raffles Hotel, so on a rainy day the Museum is definately well worth a visit as it focuses on the history of Singapore and is also a National Monument of Singapore.  Absolutely fascinating and allow a few hours here"

Interesting visit,We had an afternoon free of our children and grandchildren and the personnel at the St Regis suggested we visit the museum<br/>We were fortunate to join a museum tour and spent a most interesting afternoon learning about the history of Singapore - a bit of culture during a great time with our children in sungapore

BandS2015,74,Mar-17,Feb-17,50,An excellent place to visit on a wet day!,A well presented and very interesting museum with a variety of methods of display to keep the attention of the visitor.

KGB777,"38,159",Mar-17,Mar-17,40,Japanese Forest Animation,Came here with the kids today to see the Forest Animation exhibition. Some quite impressive graphics on display and well thought out.

TorgutPt,184,Mar-17,Mar-17,40,"A nice museu, overpriced","I liked my visit here but think the ticket is a bit expensive for this museum. Unlike other fellows wrote, the normal ticket is 15 Singapore Dollars, not 10, and that's a significant difference. That's about 10 Eur and a bit pricey for the size and quality of the exhibit. <br/><br/>Otherwise, it's a fine museum, with nice displays, approaching the history of Singapore, although if one looks closely, it becomes obvious that the collection available to the public is quite limited. Not much juice, most of the experience comes from the decoration and the care in the organization of the rooms."
,,,,,,
John W,698,Mar-17,Mar-17,50,Excellent history tour of Singapore ,"Evidently reopened last autumn after extensive renovation, this is an excellent facility which leads you through an easy to follow journey of Singapore's history. Very imaginatively laid out. <br/>The success of this tiny country since independence from Britain and subsequent separation from Malaysia is well illustrated. It has been really remarkable, and sometimes by the skin of its teeth!<br/>A guided tour night well be worthwhile though we chose to go alone.<br/>A must visit."
,,,,,,
Agnes S,62,Mar-17,Feb-17,50,National Museum of Singapore,"The museum located in Stamford Road, around SMU. And the entrance fee is S$15 for non citizen. But if you have citizen card or PR Card, you can visit free.<br/><br/>When I go, there is an exhibition themed Nature and Singapore's history. In Nature section, there is one room that full of led that show us the motion video of forest and the animal. And in History section, it show us the begining of Singapore nation and all the cultural development until now.<br/><br/>We spent almost 2,5 hours there. We really enjoy the time..."
,,,,,,
Joel B,7,Mar-17,Mar-17,50,Excellent Experience,"We had an excellent English language tour of the Singapore history section of the museum.  Volunteer guide was knowledgeable and humorous.  Gave us an excellent understanding of Singapore.  While we thought the museum was free, there was a fee to enter.  However, it was well worth the cost.  We didn't have time to see everything and would certainly go back on a future visit."
,,,,,,
Londonec1n,31,Mar-17,Mar-17,40,Good for Singapore,"Living in London can sometimes mean that other national museums don't measure up!  This is a good one though because it is compact and has interesting exhibits.  The $S15 (£7.50/$US10/¥1,200) entry is also reasonable in my view.  <br/><br/>My favourite aspect about this one is that one exhibit gives you a very good and succinct  history of Singapore.  Very well displayed with the right amount of artefacts, videos, etc to make the right impact.<br/><br/>There is a nice restaurant and bar as well as a cafe to have a break in as well.<br/><br/>Being close to everything, it's a good place to visit whilst in Singapore."
,,,,,,
Jenhendo,11,Feb-17,Feb-17,50,Enjoyable couple of hours,Really enjoyed learning a bit more about the Singapore history and loved the exhibitions we saw during our visit.  The food was very good at the cafe too. Well worth a visit!

,,,,,,
Col_Tra_W,20,Feb-17,Feb-17,50,Lovely Peaceful place,"Great place to learn the history of Singapore and how Europeans helped and hindered the Singapore people and culture.  Cannot remember the costs of Entry but I think it was less than 10SPD per person.<br/><br/>Highly recommended and I think we spent about 4 or 5 hours there, but that included a spot of lunch as well."

keentravellerNotts,45,Feb-17,Feb-17,50,A wet day find!!!,"We are NOT museum people but this place is something else. Heavy rain so went there. 10 Singapore Dollars and spent 4 hours!!! 2nd floor Rotunda is one long, spiralling DVD screen showing plants and animals of the area. A sort of planetarium where you lie on bean bags and look up at projections on ceiling of flower petals falling down. Magical. Rooms showing stages of Singapore life with interactive displays - even a drive in cinema!!!!! Do go.,"

Mark&Rosa,507,Feb-17,Feb-17,50,One of the best museums ever,"This is a must see museum. Singapore's history is relatively new, but it has packed much into its time. There is so much to learn about Singapore, especially from WWII onward. The exhibits are excellent as are the narrations. We managed to spend 5 1/2 hours there before we realized what the time was."

Chris W,174,Feb-17,Feb-17,50,High standard ,"Typically classy, creative and organised. Singaporean museums are generally impressive but this was my favourite. We spent almost five hours here! The historic time line was my favourite part because the city has had such a rich and interesting history. Being English it is always especially interesting to me when my own countries history is woven into the history of others and for once not in an entirely negative way!"
,,,,,,
Pukalicious,164,Feb-17,Aug-16,50,One of my favourite National Museums,"I spent two hours learning the roots of Singapore, how did they create the country. I love this place a lot.

I7063UE,42,Feb-17,Jan-17,50,Just Amazing,"Stuck in Singapore over 3 day weekend public holiday. Other booked tours cancelled last minute by companies. So set out on my own walking adventure and found a beautifully architectured building housing the National Museum of Singapore, free entry. Most enjoyable was the chronological history of Singapore including the invasion, recovery and earlier philanthropist and pioneers of development and Singapore society."
,,,,,,
kuede,504,Feb-17,Feb-17,50,Must see when in Singapore,"It is not just the art exhibited which is worth seeing. Equally worthwhile and interesting is to see the architecture of the old Supreme Court and Government building. To see all - plan at least 2-3 hours. There are some excellent restaurants on this site, although most are only open for dinner."
,,,,,,
Pam M,27,Feb-17,Feb-17,50,"Great collection, perfect at the hot part of the day","The museum is exceptionally well done.  You need a fair amount of time to really take it in.  Better if you don't consider it a ""walking trail"" and spend the time to read the interpretive panels.  Plan for a few hours at least.  Not a stop, but a destination."

betty l,"9,804",Feb-17,Feb-17,40,Waited 16 Years To Visit This Place,"I have lived in Singapore for 10 years and was away for 6, but this was my very first visit to this Museum. Being a Permanent Resident, my entrance to both the Permanent Galleries and Special Exhibitions was free. I joined the hour long guided tour and altho I pretty much know a bit about Singapores history it gave me further insight into some unknown past of Singapore. It was a very informative one hour tour on Singapores history. After my guided tour, I went to the SPecial Exhibition from a French Regional Collections and the exhibits were very interesting. I also went up to the second floor to see a very colourful and innovative approach to art...the Glass Rotunda: Story of a Forest which was a light and sound art exhibit. I would highly recommend a visit to this museum."
,,,,,,
Hal C,9,Feb-17,Feb-17,50,Begin here if you've never been to Singapore,"This is the place to start if you want to know anything about the history of Singapore.  It's a beautiful museum with a great variety of smaller exhibits dealing with history, the arts, and so on.  I really enjoyed it as a way to get started understanding Singapore.  Afterwards, go out the back and have a walk through the beautiful Fort Canning Park."
,,,,,,
DebTwoHoots,304,Feb-17,Jan-17,50,Top place,This was a great museum with lots of interesting features.  It gave us a real insight into the history and culture of Singapore.  It is definitely worth a visit.

Den S,10,Feb-17,Jan-17,40,The Rotunda is worth a visit in itself,I enjoyed the Museum. The cafe also provides excellent lunches and the whole experience is of a modern Museum explaining Singapore and its history. I took the tour guide (free) which I would recommend. The Rotunda experience with the digital moving mosaic/tapestry and flowers falling from the sky is hard to describe but amazing!
,,,,,,
Thomas Q,32,Feb-17,Jan-17,50,More impressive as you go deeper inside.,"When I first went inside, I didn't think this place was going to be all that special.   Past the front entrance there was a giant, 10 or 15 feet  sphere of thousands of pots and pans suspended on individual strings from the ceiling.<br/>But once I was deeper inside, I found some very thoughtful presentations on the history of Singapore from its early days as a colony to the WWII occupation and up to the present.     There is a major exhibition of the founder of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, showing his personal effects and telling the history of post war independence and nation building.   The front part of the museum is what used to be the national library built probably in the Victorian era and the back half is an entirely modern glass and steel structure.    It integrates well with the older front half and is awesome visually.  Inside the new part of the museum is something that resembles a planetarium, but in this case is a forest.   There are dozens of projectors that makes you feel you are inside this imaginary forest at night as you descend a spiral ramp.   It is very well done and a great place to take children to.<br/>Of course, the message is ""be kind to the environment.""   In the historical exhibitions, there are artifacts of early colony life, a replica of a old wooden trading ship.  There are diaries, ration documents and enacted testimonies from citizens who suffered through the WWII Japanese occupation .    There is one exhibition on postwar Singapore, showing the consumer goods such as TVs, radios, toys that fill the homes of a society that gradually because more prosperous.   There is also a café and restaurant inside the museum to rest your weary feet."

Agatha659,32,Feb-17,Jan-17,40,Creative exhibitions,"A lovely museum in a beautiful building, lots of space and light. I only got to see two exhibitions but they were both so good the time just ran away and before we knew it four hours had gone! The history of Singapore exhibition was very interesting and well thought out and the forest exhibition in the glass rotunda was stunning. What I saw in this museum was not the conventional layout and thought process of a lot of museums. Here they take you on a journey of discovery. I will definitely return here to see more. Oh there is an entry cost but as I went just after Chinese New Year it was free entry so I cannot say how much this is. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was just because I didn't spot a good shop where I would have loved to have bought souvenirs of the exhibitions I did see. They may well have one but if so I missed it. If they don't it's an opportunity missed!"

C D,155,Feb-17,Feb-17,50,Wonderful museum,"I hadn't been to this museum since it was renovated several years ago. It has always been, architecturally, a beautiful museum. But now, the exhibits match the grandeur and history.<br/>The exhibits cover Singapore's colorful and fascinating history, both visually and auditory. I can't recommend it enough for a first time visitor or the frequent visitor unfamiliar with the background of this beautiful country"

suesalford,355,Jan-17,Feb-17,40,Extensively refurbished and oldest museum in singapore,"Our visit took at least two hours to view the Singapore history section on the ground floor plus the life in Singapore exhibition on the first floor. The older buildings have been linked beautifully with a light airy atrium, including escalators, excellent toilet facilities, a cafe and a restaurant. Both eating places were quite up market and expensive. Interesting exhibition of the living forest in the glass rotunda with lots of digital displays and an amazing projection which was quite disorientating. Entrance was discounted for being over 60, so $11 instead of the $20 plus, some benefits of seniority even here!"

Aethelred,832,Jan-17,Jan-17,40,"Programmatic, modern museum","that presents the quasi-official narrative of Singapore just how this is done in state-of-the-art museums today.  Typical Singaporean post-post-modern refurbishment of a classic-colonial building.  Two overhyped restaurants where you need reservations even for lunch - i.e. places that should *not* be in a museum, where the idea is that you can have a nice lunch break during your visit.  Spontaneously.  (Ok, Singaporeans love to queue and to reserve, but this is really ridiculous.)  The highlight for me clearly was the forest story installation; this is magical, well-done, and also great for kids of all ages."

johannnindito,117,Jan-17,Nov-16,50,Fascinating Museum!,"You have to put this place into your list, especially when you walk around Orchard Road. You will reach this museum by MRT, either from Dhoby Gaut (Plaza Singapura) or Bras Basah.<br/><br/>This museum covers the Singapore's chronicles from pre-historic, colonial development, and modern Singapore as multicultural nation and society. Instead its main story of colonial period and modern Singapore, this museum also includes a number of contemporary multimedia exhibitions from world's artists. Museum's staff are so friendly and helpful. Small area in this museum also offers foods and beverages with reasonable price."

Ken L,206,Jan-17,Jan-17,50,Brighten up a rainy day. Interesting history of Singapore,"Good museum. Well worth three hours or so. Lots of different media: videos, audio recordings, exhibition style as well as the usual exhibits. Everything from the early colonial days, to the birth of the nation and the growth to the power house of today. Plus changing exhibitions."

2torontotraveller,"1,958",Jan-17,Jan-17,50,Do This Museum First!,This was the first attraction that we went to in Singapore.  It is a good place to start as it covers the history of Singapore from about 6000 years ago to current day.  Singapore is an amazing place where several races live in Harmony.  This museum covers the journey to get there.  <br/><br/>It took us about 4 hours to go through the museum and we ate lunch there.  This is a good quality museum and I recommend going to see it.<br/><br/>To get there I would recommend using the Bras Basah metro instead of the City Hall metro as this is a long walk especially when the temperature is high and it is humid.
,,,,,,
AuntyGill,5,Jan-17,Jan-17,40,Colonial Past,"The main exhibits give the fascinating story of the development of Singapore from early times but the main story was of its Colonial development.  Singapore today owes a lot to the foresight of those early entrepreneurs. People of all nationalities who flocked to Singapore to work are represented as well as the higher echelons.  How they lived before, during and after WW2, how they dressed, entertained themselves and coped with hardships was well portrayed.  We spent 4 hours absorbing it all and could have spent longer.<br/><br/>The café provided a good selection of food and drinks and the waiting staff were very friendly and helpful."

Traveler2009,"1,163",Jan-17,Jan-17,50,Just right ,"This is a well put together, informative and very representative of Singapore as a nation.   You would expect that, from a country renowned for efficiency.   While small, the museum provides relevant  information in the history of the country , without trying to go too too far in the past.   It can be argued that Singapore is a new country and therefore there is not much history , Well, visit the museum and you will see that it's not quite like that.   The museum is in close proximity to two MRT stations; Dhoby Ghauht and Bras Basah and several bus stations       While most people don't associate Singapore with museum visits , I would strongly suggest a visit ; good break from shopping !"

keentraveller27,387,Jan-17,Dec-16,50,Super Interesting,"Access to this museum is via taxi so while leaving request security to call a taxi for you; they are super helpful. This museum is great filled with interesting crystal chandeliers,galleries including Stamford Gallery,Life in Singapore, Voices of Singapore, Modern Colony, Surviving Syonan. It houses very interesting a modern projection wall on the flora and fauna in Singapore through all the various seasons,Singapore through the ages, abstract art, modern art, spaces left to imagination with lights and projection mapping.Gallery 10 is very interesting. It is a quirky mix of new and old. At the centre there is Cooking the World sculpture of aluminium vessels and the interpretation of the artist is very interesting. Definitely a great trip and a must see in Singapore."

Amirah A,106,Jan-17,Nov-16,40,Great for Singapore's history,It's one of the nicest museum in Singapore - it closes early so best to be there in the morning (escape the afternoon crowd) &amp; take a walk to nearby Dhoby Ghaut afterwards for lunch. They have new exhibition every year so check out their website as well!

SiamWanderer,"1,738",Jan-17,Dec-16,40,best way to beat the heat,"Learn a thing or two, or more, about Singapore's not too long history. At the same time, for a small price to pay, you get to enjoy airconditioning and a bit of respite from the tropical afternoon sun... and perhaps some shelter from the tropical rain and thunderstorm. (note that weather is unpredictable in Sg and you should always check the weather forecast... and trust it some of the time). <br/>The museum is a great place to see and learn about this small, great island. <br/>The gift shop also stocks some interesting and unique knick-knacks that can be obtained for a small price to pay. <br/><br/>Visit the musuems. today"

Ida B,763,Jan-17,Jan-17,50,I learned a lot from my visit to this museum! Must come back soon!,"I did not realise that behind the facade of this historical there are so much to see so much to do! By the way, the building itself is amazing! <br/><br/>I didn't know where to begin which one I should start exploring. But my first impression on entering the entrance, it was like 'wow', I was faced with an installation of a ball of 'pots and pans' handed under the rotunda. Then as I explored, there was one after another piece of art or object, or even the interior of the building that attracted my attention. <br/><br/>They had a number of temporary exhibitions - which I enjoyed thoroughly, it was about 'Forest' - how the exhibition ensured that visitors get the chance to interact with what was exhibited. The exhibition made me got so interested and immersed in what they want us to know. <br/><br/>It was like in every part of the museum, they make sure that we stay attracted, and stimulated our way of thinking, making sure we think beyond our normal day-to-day thinking, deeper in thoughts.<br/><br/>I will definitely be back whenever I get the chance."

MrDavetheSarks,"17,180",Jan-17,Jul-16,30,Explores the History of Singapore,"As it turned out this museum wasn't a museum of natural history (which is what I was expecting when I walked in through the door) but rather a museum of the history of the city of Singapore. It was actually quite interesting, and told me a lot more about the background of the city that the exhibition I visited the last time I was here (which was basically the story of Singapore told through the newspaper). It is interesting, but probably not a go to place if there are other things you wish to do."
,,,,,,
JennyHCO15,9,Jan-17,Jan-17,50,Well worth a visit,"We visited the museum after our drink at Raffles. It's only 5 /10 minute walk down Stamford Road. The main exhibit - the history of Singapore took us about 2 hours to walk round and took us from the 14th Century up to date. Good visual and audio exhibits including films,original letters portraits and and original documents all of which painted a comprehensive picture of Singapore history. The exhibit  documenting everyday day life from the beginning of the 20th century, the fall of the island to the Japanese during the Second World War through to independence, was particularly interesting and added another dimension  to our visit to Changi prison the previous day. There are a couple of smaller exhibits covering trees and couple of sensory rooms on the first floor.  Not really our thingThe cafe and souvenir shop are reasonably priced. the entrance fee was bout 11 Singapore dollars"
,,,,,,
Lpool94,154,Jan-17,Jan-17,50,Worth a visit,"We really enjoyed looking around the national museum and would definitely say it's worth a visit.

Zeeshan P,5,Jan-17,Jan-17,50,Great museum with good free tour guides,This is a good place to visit if you are looking to learn more about the history of Singapore. I would highly recommend walking through the museum with one of the free tours provided by the museum.
,,,,,,
bonnet2,35,Jan-17,Feb-16,20,Not Free and not much to see,The museum building itself is beautiful and clean. Location is easy to access.<br/>They do bring some FREE events however they keep charging a little things if they can.<br/><br/>Foreigner residents are kept charged while all Singaporean can be free which is not a nice concepts. They keep forgetting many foreigners are supporting this country and should be treated fairly.<br/><br/>Children's weeks events used to be more attractions and fun but it is deteriorating and not fun anymore. I do not know why authorities would not put more effort for such events to motivate children's artistic senses and curiosities. <br/><br/>I wish more improvements and efforts.

SingaporeGirl,533,Jan-17,Oct-16,40,The Place to discover Singapore's History,"A series of smaller galleries are offshoots to a main gallery that tells visitors the history of Singapore -- via artefacts, music, historical recordings, videos, and excellent local docents (worth waiting to catch a free 60-minute tour) bring together this city better than any guidebook could. Two hours spent here is one of the best investments visitors can make. Put it top of your list and the rest of Singapore (Little India, Chinatown, Raffles Statue, boat quay) all fall into place afterwards. Small coffeeshop for snacks and light meals and a fine dining restaurant (that is obviously used by the local business crowd at lunch and couples dining out in the evenings) had a very tempting menu. Don't miss the outdoor sculpture and if you're in luck, there might even be a special visiting exhibition while you're there as well (they've had mummies from the British Museum, a Pompeii exhibit, etc. in the past)."
,,,,,,
Isaac S,464,Jan-17,Jan-17,50,A museum of wonders,"It's sad that museums are sometimes stereotyped to be boring, because the National Museum of Singapore is truly a wonder.<br/><br/>The exhibits are all presented ever so creatively, with props and visual aids that really bring out the atmosphere and allow you to immerse yourself into the past. Of course, for many of us, the different exhibits also present opportunities for us to take our photos and OOTDs.<br/><br/>There are many different exhibits in the museum, spread across different floors. The permanent ones include exhibits like Singapore History Gallery, Growing Up (where you get to see the kampung life of the 1950s and 60s), Surviving Syonan (where you can listen to stories of those who have been through the Japanese Occupation in Singapore during World War II).<br/><br/>My favourite from the permanent exhibits would be the Glass Rotunda, which has been furnished and reopened recently, this time with an installation known as the Story of the Forest. It was really amazing, as you could almost immerse yourself entirely into this fantasy world with lights and images of the forest and the magical creatures.<br/><br/>Right now, there is also a temporary exhibit called What is Not Visible is not Invisible, which is pretty interesting with its many installations. And yes, these are the exhibits that make good photo opportunities for your Instagram or Facebook feed. <br/><br/>It's free for Singapore citizens and PRs, and even for tourists, the admission fee is worth paying for, because the museum is really a masterpiece.<br/><br/>To get there, take the train to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, and take any exit from the North-South Line (red line). Then, walk towards Rendezvous Hotel and Singapore Management University (SMU). Behind SMU, you would see a building with the words ""YMCA"" on it. The National Museum of Singapore is just next to it."

FishingwithScotto,144,Jan-17,Dec-16,40,Always worth a visit to the local museum,We always try and visit the local museums in our travels and suggest that the Singapore National Museum is worth a few hours of your time.

After a number of disappointing museum visits throughout Southeast Asia, I was wowed by the quality of the collections and accompanying explanations. It was great to learn more about Singapore and the Japanese occupation. There were also several very impressive exhibitions. Admission was free when we visited, but it appears that may have changed recently. Still, this museum is certainly worth a fee!"

Elizabeth K,77,Dec-16,Dec-16,50,Spellbinding vituual forest digital art installation in upgraded glass rotunda,"Spellbinding virtual forest is a must see at the National Museum of Singapore.<br/><br/>As well as the watercolour renderings of the Farquhar commissioned  collection of regional Singapore 19th century flora and fauna; new to the National Museum of Singapore is the virtual forest-- a digital art installation in the glass rotunda. Singapore has no equal when it comes to bringing the environment to life and while this installation will capture the imagination of everyone, it mesmerised the children. Visitors enter the dome. As you  cross the bridge  you are surrounded by tumbling flowers. As you continue to walk through the rotunda surrounded by the virtual forest the animals move in the forest, pouncing and crying out. At the base of the rotunda you can lie back on huge bean bags and observe luminous  trees and flowers. I suggest, however, you get up and walk around  the walls as the more people in the space the more trees and flowers there are."

Susan D,"2,093",Dec-16,Nov-16,30,Disjointed,"I visited this Museum after taking a wonderful tour of the Battlebox as it is very close to Fort Canning Park.<br/><br/>The lady on the desk was very helpful and advised me that a tour would begin at 1 p.m. if I would like to join it.  She pointed to the spot where I was to meet the guide.  As I had an hour to wait, I went and had a fish and chips lunch (S$16.00 ++) at the Terrace Café.  Unfortunately the fish, covered in thick batter, was almost inedible because the fillets under the batter were dark and slimy.<br/><br/>At 12.50 p.m. I returned to the place which had been pointed out to me but when no-one else had turned up by 1.20 p.m. I left and explored the exhibits by myself.<br/><br/>I agree with the previous reviewer who said that the exhibit which explains the history of Singapore is like a maze.  I found it disjointed with no clear indication of the pathway to follow in order to view the displays.  Therefore, I often found myself out of sequence with the timeline.<br/><br/>I had afternoon tea at the Food For Thought Café, which was very crowded, before walking to Bras Basah MRT Station to catch the train back to my hotel."

Lots of history of local culture, both rich and poor Singaporeans and immigrants.  Plenty of photos and memorabilia.  A good well laid out museum.  Restaurant was inexpensive and had a good choice."

GreenoreII,46,Nov-16,Nov-16,50,All of Singapore history in a few hours,Excellent rainy day activity!  The museum has an area devoted to Lee Kuan Yew that truly explains how the city state became such a cultural and economic marvel. Other exhibits describe life in different decades leads no up to the present.

Colin F,923,Nov-16,Oct-16,50,A Purpose Built Museum,"This grand Palladian structure provides plenty of exhibition space.  Take your passport for a senior entrance rate.  If you approach from the Fort Canning side it is not easy to get in as the ticket office is at the other side of the building and there are no signs to tell you this.  However, once in it is well worth the visit with themed areas covering the history of Singapore."

Ouzo10,336,Nov-16,Nov-16,50,Fascinating!,"We visited the museum primarily for me to get a photo of the stunningly beautiful building.  However, it was bucketing down and we were tired, so thought we'd escape the weather, find a cafe inside and rest up for a bit.  Very reasonable prices, so we bought tickets, found the cafe (there's also a restaurant) and did just that.  Then we started exploring.  It's wonderful, and the displays have been cleverly and thoughtfully arranged.  Particularly enjoyed the History Gallery.  Highly recommended."

DragonLass-Aus,"3,286",Nov-16,Nov-16,50,Extremely well curated museum,"We spent a bit over 4 hours here going through all the exhibitions.  The museum is wonderfully put together, providing great information on the history of Singapore right up to fairly recent history (the 80s).  We took one of the free guided tours first which was excellent,  The tour takes you through the main history gallery.  The rest of the galleries are very easy to self tour, the 2nd level goes through different time periods of the 1900s, the section from the occupation years is particularly touching.  We also took in the current temporary exhibition in the basement, a very modern art exhibition that is very interesting.<br/>We ate lunch at the cafe near the souvenir shop, the food was really excellent and reasonably priced, I can highly recommend it."

The What is Not Visible is Not Invisible exhibition in the basement gallery is particularly interesting (exhibition showing until 19 Feb 2017).<br/><br/>This is great activity if you want to escape the humidity or heavy rains!

SeeingTheWordFromORD,218,Nov-16,Nov-16,40,Interesting museum,"This is the oldest museum in Singapore and it is quite interesting. We particularly enjoyed the Singapore History Gallery and The Modern Colony Gallery. We Built a Nation, the Gallery focused on Singapore's first years of independence, was quite small - but provided insight into the leadership of Singapore's first Prime MInister and government. The museum is fairly small so easy to navigate. There is, additionally, a cafe with a very nice menu.<br/><br/>The only negative comment I would make is that the schoolchildren visiting the museum were allowed to run rampant through the exhibits, yelling loudly. I was quite surprised they were not better behaved."

We were told that they could tell that we follow a ""Japanese"" culture and were not welcome here by the security, one of our goth friends was told that he looked like the ""devil"" and was not allowed to come in.<br/><br/>However there was a very friendly staff member in the gallery whom explained the meanings and origins of the paintings to us, she was really nice and understanding, it improved the visit a lot for us. :)"

It is just ashamed if you miss the tour when to visit it."

William C,13,Nov-16,Oct-16,50,From Swamp to Super City in 50 Years,"Home to the world's most successful social engineering experiment, Singapore is a wonder whose story is told here. The floor plan is almost a maze of corners and byways, and tells the story of the founding of a small but mighty nation. Always cool and comfortable inside, the story unfolds of how a small backwater fishing village became the economic powerhouse it is today. It wasn't easy! Oppressed and occupied in WW2, Singapore gained it's independence only in 1965. If you're not a history buff, skip it. But, if you are a admirer of human achievement and determination, don't miss it."

robert_and_anne,55,Oct-16,Oct-16,50,Once upon a time in Singapore,"The museum consists of two parts, which you can visit separately. One is a museum of art with changing exhibitions and in the other the history of the city-state of Singapore is presented. We visited the latter. <br/>The emergence of Singapore is in an alternating manner shown by means of film images, slide projections, documents, photographs and objects with a story. We think that it is therefore also suitable for children over 8 years, but then as parents you can spend less time in the galleries. In that case you get less information about the background of the history of this city-state, and why things have gone as they have gone. The exposés about that we found fascinating. <br/>In addition, we had the impression that as the history becomes more recent,  this is dealt with more superficial  (such as the union, and thereafter the break with Malaysia).  This is logical when you consider that former choices and interests can still play a role in the current political situation.<br/><br/>For visitors who are interested in how the unique Singapore has arisen, we can recommend this museum. Expect a visit time of 30 minutes (with children) to 1.5 hours or longer if you want to take note of all backgrounds ."
,,,,,,
SL9999,913,Oct-16,Oct-16,50,"Informative, good for history buffs","This museum is not very large, but has a very interesting way of telling Singapore's history. Some of the exhibits take the visitor through the personal journey of individual Singaporeans and uses that as a tool to explain the history of the country, spanning over a thousand years, with more focus on the last two hundred years of course. This is certainly a rather unusual way of presenting history, and made it all the more interesting.<br/><br/>For anyone with an interest in history generally or in Singapore's history particularly, this is a very good place to start. The building is nice as well, and there are couple of places to eat on site, including a fine dining restaurant and a casual cafe style place (Food for Thought) where we had a late lunch. Since there are not too many galleries, it would take about 3 - 4 hours to cover. About a 10 min walk from City Hall MRT.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for history buffs."

gregh747438,10,Oct-16,Oct-16,40,1st time in Singapore? Then this should be your first destination!,"Even if museums are not your thing, the National Museum of Singapore gives first time visitors to Singapore a great introduction to Singapore's history and the events (including political/cultural influences) that have given birth to the modern, independent nation today. The history of Singapore section can be easily experienced in 2 to 3 hours or you can spend longer if you desire to see some of the other artifacts on display. It's not a big museum when compared to the British Museum or the National Archeological Museum in Athens but the history display (a chronological walk through time) is very informative and interesting."
,,,,,,
Judy B,14,Oct-16,Oct-16,50,Great overview of Singapore's History,"We went to this museum on the first day of our trip.  We didn't know much about the history of Singapore, and this was the perfect place to learn about it.  A tour was just beginning when we arrived, and we felt very lucky because the tour guide was really good.  She knew how to move our group around the museum and we felt we saw all of the important exhibits with her.  The museum is laid out beautifully and there are a lot of examples of memorabilia -for example a rickshaw, a sample kitchen - it reminded us of our favorite museum in our home city, the Oakland Museum.  We highly recommend visiting this museum if you go to Singapore."

antonvanold,"1,223",Oct-16,Mar-16,50,Very good museum on the history of Singapore,"The museum had a temporary exhibit of artifacts from the British Museum that was well laid out with plenty of space to move about and take pictures. <br/><br/>The permanent exhibits were arranged in different halls according to theme. They had one on post WWII toys that was great, and other sections that focused on the history of Singapore. The choices of artifacts and the manner of presentation and lighting were very good. <br/><br/>In the photos I have in this review are a Type 95 Ha Go Tank replica, weighing 3.5 tons, was one of four built for the miniseries The Pacific. Its was based on an original in the from the Australian War Memorial. This flag is signed by Captain Kameo Sonokawa, the pilot who led the Genzan Air Corps in the attack that resulted in the sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse. The anchor is from the RMS Empress of Asia, a troopship that was sunk and the captured crew and troops aboard the liner were shipped to Thailand and Burma to work on the Death Railway."

Richard W,96,Oct-16,Oct-16,50,Great building with easy to follow displays,"We like visiting major museums as they can provide really good information about the country or city you are visiting.  This was no exception and really told the story of Singapore from early through to modern times.  The displays were easy to read and follow, as well as being rather interesting."

wihte_sandy_beach,43,Oct-16,Oct-16,30,Nice but nothing really special,"The museum have some informative items, but nothing really special. It is just like compilation of few informative stuffs in one place. So instead of searching in books about history of Singapore, one can just visit this museum to see some old photos, old movies or little stuff about olden days Singapore. There are some old drawings and also old and new paintings. The other museum (Asian Civilization museum) have more interesting things to see."
,,,,,,
Frankascanbe,105,Oct-16,May-16,30,"Stunning building, too little content","It's important to remember that I'm coming at this from an Irish perspective and so I expect a museum to have a lot of old stuff, very old stuff! This one does not, I understand that Singapore is a young country but vast space is thinly furnished with exhibits from WWII and poorly edited shows about the great kampong fire, I understand that this is an important event but the details are explored exhaustively. <br/>The building itself is wonderfully restored, all credit for this amazing job which marries the old a new in a world class example of how to restore and modernise an old space. I hope over time the management here with think outside the box and develop this museum to broader and more griping. Having said all that it's worth a visit."
,,,,,,
Jenny P,98,Oct-16,Jun-16,50,Lovely building and informative displays,"There are different sections to the museum with free permanent exhibits and ticketed displays, plus a foyer filled with kids activities.

Jenanime,188,Oct-16,Oct-16,40,Well presented and informative museum! :),"This is a very well laid-out, presented and informative museum. It is free for residents to enter, but foreigners will have to pay 10S$ for the entry fee and an additional 4$ for the special exhibits (I thought the experience was well worth the price though). They offer tours by knowledgeable and passionate volunteer guides in both English and Mandarin. Check with reception on the next available tour in your preferred language when you first arrive.<br/><br/>The special exhibit I went to called ""What is not visible is not invisible"", which is running from 7th October 2016 to 19th February 2017, was great fun as there was a room filled with green balloons. I was beyond happy and played in here for ages unleashing my inner child.<br/><br/>The museum covers the history and culture of Singapore from its days as Singapura to modern day Singapore. It was fascinating learning about all the different historical aspects of daily life such as the vintage clothes people used to wear, the food they ate and the toys children played with. I was actually genuinely moved by the poignant footage of Lee Kuan Yew announcing the independence of Singapore on that historic day in 1965. You could easily spend more than 3 hours at the National Museum of Singapore immersed in the interactive exhibits and having fun enriching your knowledge of Singapore! :)"

Serene,8,Oct-16,Oct-16,50,This museum is amazing!,"First visit to this museum. Went in the afternoon period and realised that time wasn't enough for us to walk finish the whole galleries there. We only have chance to walk one gallery which is the Singapore history gallery. And it already took a few hours time for us to finish that one gallery. We both took around 100 and more photos in one gallery. We were kinda shocked. Knowing that, we will be back again next time to visit the other galleries."

TheEddiesduo,263,Oct-16,Sep-16,40,"Great range of exhibits, very worthwhile",Had a great visit to the museum which has a wealth of information about Singapore and surrounds. It is set out over a number of levels as you'd expect and we took about 2 hours to traverse all the exhibits. There is currently a photographic display which is well worth  look. There is a cafe on site if you get peckish. We entered from the top level after checking out Fort Canning but you must proceed to the ground floor and purchase a ticket which gets you a sticker for your top so the security guys can tell you've paid. No entry to some of the exhibits without one.

Darren L,549,Oct-16,Sep-16,40,Surprisingly Informative,"Truth is, I was apprehensive about visiting the National Museum of Singapore (or any museum in Singapore) - I mean, being a local, we never really had a great impression of museums in our own backyard. <br/><br/>I must say, I was proven wrong. The museum was much better than expected. <br/><br/>The museum sits in a quiet corner in between the central business and shopping districts next to our Singapore Management University. The rustic building brings a sense of nostalgic feeling and stands out among the more modern buildings surrounding it. <br/><br/>Going into the museum takes you to a world different from the hustle and bustle of the city around it. I do applaud the wonderfully informative exhibits on Singapore's history and our road to being a developed nation. There is a mix of audio, video and displays which will keep you relatively entertained for a good 90 to 120mins. <br/><br/>I especially like (and this is for all locals), the new exhibit on our ""modern founding father"", the late Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. It may have been a year but it still touches a chord and you get to see actual artifacts (clothes, bicycle, the famous red briefcase) of Mr Lee's life.<br/><br/>And as you would expect from the Singaporean customer service standards, the staff of the museum are friendly and helpful. <br/><br/>I recommend the museum to all, friends from abroard and locals alike, to visit."

isakbroman,9,Oct-16,Oct-16,50,Very educating and interesting museum,"The museum is exactly what I hoped it would be. It takes you through the whole history of Singapore, from the first recorded activity of humans living there, through the colonization to the WW2 and when the country got independent and how it became the modern metropolis it is today. I spent 2 hours walking through the corridors and could have spent more time if I really wanted to read it all. A must visit for the history interested!"

Chris W,45,Oct-16,Oct-16,30,Impressive building but slightly disappointing content for families,We decided to visit based on other reviews that suggested this was quite a child friendly destination. While the building itself was beautiful we did feel that the majority of the exhibits on show when we visited were more aimed at adults (or at least teenagers). The sections on Singapore's history and cultures etc were well presented and informative with lots of reading and visual displays to enjoy. We just wish we didn't have two primary school age kids trying to hurry us along! On a positive we had a lovely lunch at the relaxed cafe on sites (especially the beef salad). Worth a visit if you are the target audience or have more patient/cultured kids than us ;)

Bothy2473,67,Oct-16,Oct-16,40,Wonderful place to learn the development of Singapore,We spent 2 hours in the main history gallery learning and understanding the development of Singapore which as very interesting. Perhaps not suitable for very young children.  There is a cafe on the ground floor.  The other galleries were add-ons from the 20th century showing fashion and life-style.  We actually visited on a rare rainy day in Singapore!!
,,,,,,
Ashish_K_008,8,Oct-16,Oct-16,40,Must visit - 3 hours well spent!,"Singapore has a relatively short history. The recorded part of the history starts from around the 15th century AD, and the National Museum does a wonderful job of presenting that - especially from the time of British rule. Getting to know how a small country made up mostly of immigrants climbed its way up to being one of the most developed nations in the world, is quite fascinating. The museum has lots of engaging video content as well.<br/>The only thing we felt missing was that probably there should have been a comprehensive audio guide to help make the experience even better."

BlueBrrr,186,Oct-16,Sep-16,40,Good Overview of the History of Singapore,"I visited the National Museum of Singapore on a weekday morning. It opens at 10:00 am. The museum's main exhibit is the history of Singapore, located on the ground level of the structure. It is a good place to visot to understand how Singapore came to be. There are other smaller exhibits in the museum worth visiting as well. At the time of my visit, there were several groups of school children on a field trip, so the museum was quite busy. <br/><br/>Tip: The 3rd level of the museum has an exit to Fort Canning Park.  From there you can explore the park and visit the Battlebox, a museum/tour of a military bunker located inside the hill."

Marjie781,158,Oct-16,Sep-16,50,A fascinating introduction to the history of Singapore,"The layout and set-up of the myriad of exhibits here is really outstanding. From the moment you enter, your attention is caught by the enormous map that changes, giving you an introduction to history.<br/>Following around the exhibits, the amount of detail given, the way each item linked with the next, the use of space to guide you on your 'exploration' was brilliant.<br/>The team that planned and set this up is to be congratulated.<br/>A few more spots to sit and contemplate all the historical implications, would have been great."

This was generally very well presented and certainly gave me the opportunity to gain a better understanding of Singapore's history. It might just demonstrate my ignorance, but I was very moved (and I will admit surprised) by the video of Lee Kuan Yew crying on live television when discussing the separation of Singapore from Malaysia."

If you want to learn how Lee Kuan Yew created a modern city for his people, this is the museum to visit. Peggy was an extremely knowledgable tour guide and told the story of her beloved Singapore in a very engaging way.   Unfortunately I had to leave the tour just as we got to the time of the Japanese occupation, but when I return to Singapore I will return to this excellent museum."

Tanksmon,537,Sep-16,Sep-16,40,"Good info, but uneven presentation. ","Although I am glad I went to the national museum, I was a little disappointed at the time and what was missing in the presentation.  They glossed over a lot of WW2 and also the experience of the Chinese. I am glad I went to the Chinatown experience because it effectively rounded out what was missing in the national museum.  The exhibits were good, but the tone was generally uncritical of the colonial period and the Malaysia. Issues.  It is an encouraging stop, just not much use if you are looking for an authentic interpretation of Singapore history."

Bob A,254,Sep-16,Sep-16,50,AN ABSOLUTE GOLD MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you come to Singapore---COME HERE you will not regret or FORGET it.There<br/>is so much to learn ,so much to see &amp; hear with the interactive headphones.Just so<br/>much to learn about this small island nation that has been to hell &amp; back.The effects<br/>of the second world war &amp; the clean up of the river &amp; reclamation of land is explained in detail."
,,,,,,
Lindsay B,32,Sep-16,Aug-16,30,Walk through history,"I went here as I wanted to learn about Singapore pre colonial rule. The displays are interesting and informative but I was expecting a bigger collection. The post WWII and modern history area did not interest me at all and my entire visit was over in about 40 minutes. Not much here for kids, and I was happy to move on."

Quang Kiet Le,700,Sep-16,Sep-16,50,Visit it to understand more about Singapore,"Located in an old house that reflected a proud history of Singapore, the national museum was one of places we visited in our first day in the country. The galleries were absolutely amazing that took us back to hundred years ago to understand more about Singapore and its rich history and traditions. I think it should a must while visiting Singapore."

Karan A,619,Sep-16,Sep-16,40,Awesome depiction of how a country became so developed &amp; powerful in such a short time!,"'Bird park was opened as early as 1971, it also has one of the world's tallest man-made waterfalls.' I came across such facts and many more in our 4 hours of visit to National Museum.<br/><br/>How to get there: We took Red line mrt. Got down at Dhoby Ghat and took Exit A. It is 5 minutes walk to National museum from mrt.<br/><br/>Tickets: We bought tickets from there, 10 SGD/ per head. Not required for kids below 3. Free for PR/ Singaporeans.<br/><br/>As we entered the building, architectural marvel welcomed us. As we walked further, we passed through a souvenir shop. On the left was a cafe but he head straight to the gallery at level 1. At the start are some rocks dating back few centuries, big wooden ship, some earthen vessels, jewellery and a wall playing a video.<br/><br/>As we proceeded further, things became far more interesting. There are various information boards, pictures, paintings. It starts when the land was Singapora to Crown Jewel (of British) to Syonan To (Japanese rule), Independence, merger with Malaysia, separation and a new identity.<br/><br/>The whole museum is amazing conceptualized and built. If somebody want to know how a nation is built from nothing to a great developed and powerful one within a generation - this is the story. Study everything, absorb and understand.<br/><br/>You will come out as an enriched person known much more about history, people, culture. Post separation with Malaysia and the way LKY (there is a 7 minutes video on a big screen) lead the country is only to be admired and learnt from.<br/><br/>Museum is blend of keeping things old rustic and at the same time embracing technology and modern depictions when time move to present one. Historical events are unfolded via pictures and few animations. <br/><br/>At one section in level 2, it is amazing to see how the evolution in society happened. How films were promoted, when theatres were built. They also have clothes and cutlery on display. Family values, example there were campaigns like 'Girl or Boy, two are enough' OR 'Second can wait' OR 'Teenage marriage means pushing into problems - depicting a young couple with two kids and a messy house; in 1970s. I found these fascinating. This tells what the society went through and how government played great role in building a mature society.<br/><br/>There are many more interesting stories to absorb here in the museum. You should have 6+ hours if you have great interest in knowing Singapore's history.<br/><br/>As for kids go, there is nothing much to offer. Our 3 years old son enjoyed at the begining but after 2 hours, he was kind of bored. Though we kept his interests alive by showing new new things, like range of camera, fighter tanks, clothes, etc that were on display.<br/><br/>You can take some really nice pics of yours at Level 2 with sun falling directly on you from the glass ceiling with amazing architectural walls and windows. Overall, we had an enriching time and it was worth a visit.<br/><br/>If you are a tourist with handful of days in hand to roam around, you may keep this at a lower priority. This is for those who enjoy and appreciate history, wants to know about Singapore and has ample patience."

Andy-S60,"1,767",Sep-16,Sep-16,50,Tempus Fugit Here-us.....!!,"We posted in here around midday yesterday to escape the heat and humidity for an hour. We left just over 5 hours later. What a find! For $10 each we enjoyed the best learning experience ever about the history of Singapore and it's friends and foes, and each of their impacts on the way Singapore fits into modern society. The film of the really emotional speech by their PM in 1965 following 'annexation' from Malaysia almost had me in tears. Really well signposted and lots of touchy feely exhibits. Beautiful building too with places to eat and drink. A fabulous way to spend a few hours."

Tom W,139,Sep-16,Aug-16,40,"interesting museum, worth a visit",The National Museum shows the history of the city from around 1000. It shows the first occupations of the Arabs and European. Also recent history is discussed

Londontraveller1964X,164,Sep-16,Aug-16,30,An average experience,The building looks fantastic both inside and out but that was really where the experience faltered. The museum was poorly organised and confusing in its displays. It was enjoyable enough but could have been so much better if better organised. I would personally avoid this one if in Singapore which is a real shame.

RedJezandLyn,279,Sep-16,Aug-16,50,History of Singapore,"This is an excellent museum to visit to learn about the fascinating history of Singapore, from it's very early settlers through to the dreadful time experienced during WWII, and the horrendous treatment from the cruel occupying Japanese, through to it's blossoming as a prosperous, modern country. The Singapore of today is only 51 years old, and all Singaporeans should feel very proud of their history and the fantastic country it now is."

XAVIER M,10,Sep-16,Aug-16,40,Very nice museum to learn about Singapore's history,"Very well made exhibit on Singapore's origin and history.

Bosswitch,78,Sep-16,Aug-16,40,Great insight into Singapore's history,"Beautiful old building and light and airy inside. If you just go round and read the main boards you get a good insight into singapore and how it is as it is today.  Staff were very friendly and it wasn't too crowded. A party of teenage schoolchildren arrived and in England they'd be noisy, running around and a bit of a nightmare but here they were very smartly dressed in their uniforms, quiet, polite and respectful of everyone else so don't be put off if a school party arrives when you're there! We treated ourselves to lunch at the very fancy fine dining restaurant there which was excellent.  The surroundings were beautiful, food exceptionally good and service impeccable.  Treat yourself you won't be disappointed."

Bent G,"4,510",Sep-16,Aug-16,50,"""An Architectural Icon""",I was welcome to listen to a talk this August at the Singapore National Museum. I didn't know anything about the exhibition hall with the exception of on this visit. Happy to realize that I went to the the oldest museum and an architectural icon in Singapore. It's so awesome how the old design and the new are both seamlessly combined. Too terrible that I didn't get to tour the whole museum but will definitely will be planing another visit soon.

MAP67traveller,190,Aug-16,Aug-16,50,Impressive presentation of Singapore's history,Placed in a beautiful building this museum provides a great introduction to Singapore's history from the very beginning to the present day.

blairkk25,"1,980",Aug-16,Jun-16,40,Great Coverage of Singapore History,"I visited Singapore on business in June 2016.  The National Museum of Singapore is a multi-faceted museum.  I chose to focus on the part of the museum which covered Singapore's history.  The sections on World War 2 and the creation of modern Singapore were the most interesting.  There was also a special exhibit on the life of Lee Kwan Yew, Singapore's leader who is considered the father of modern Singapore and who passed away recently."

Dan M,13,Aug-16,Aug-16,40,Beautifully curated,"This museum beautifully presents a very ""cleansed"" version of Singaporean history and culture. The footage of Lee Kwan Hew discussing the establishment of Singapore is very moving."

Chiefmadapple,11,Aug-16,Jun-16,50,The Building is THE Gem,"Unless you're an avid fan of history, and really want to know more about Singapore's short history, I would skip the paid exhibits and soak in the building, shops and rotating exhibits instead.  The building's architectural design and materials is the history worth beholding.  It used to be the Raffles Library &amp; Museum and housed zoological collections that are now at the NUS Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum.  Both from within and without, there are many intimate details to find that instagrammable moment."

Mary ann S,117,Aug-16,Jul-16,50,A must do as part of your visit,"We had 4 days in Singapore and really wanted to get a sense of the history and culture. We stopped here for a few hours and it was a fantastic way to get quickly up to speed on the city from birth to present time, including through wars, the changing of countries that Colonized the country, and how social life has evolved. There are 4 rooms that focus on specific eras In the 1900s that show clothing, furniture, pictures and a great perspective of the way of life. The too. Covering WWII was particularly interesting to see how things changed with the Japanese government. It was the best way to help my children ages 10 and 13 to understand more about this city than simply the tourist exhibits and prosperity we saw on our trip. It's part of the flexipass options and close to buses and mrt stops."

Here_I_G0_Again,40,Aug-16,Aug-16,40,Great History of the Building of a Small but Mighty Nation!  Singaporean should be so proud!,"The National Museum is a 5 min walk away from the Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station, right next to the YMCA and very near Fort Canning Park.  It is filled with exhibits through the growing years of a young nation.  We took the guided tour that highlighted the Singapore History Gallery, taking us through the birth of the nation: the growing pains,occupation during WWII, independence, and so on.  The tour was about 1 hour in length and we then left to explore the museum on our own.<br/><br/>The National Museum of Singapore has definitely given my family and I a deeper appreciation of Singapore -- a small but mighty nation.  It is amazing how much thought and precision has been put into developing this nation.  Amidst it's greenery and modern architecture, Singapore is weaved together by the commitment of a multi-cultural community seeking their common good and setting aside their differences.  Singapore is so rich in it's culture and history - if you wish to see beyond the shopping, the hustle and bustle of the city, The National Museum is a good place to really appreciate the country.<br/><br/>(Thank you Barbara, our volunteer guide from the Friends of the Museums, for the guided tour and sharing your personal experience growing up in Singapore.  You made our trip extra special!)"
,,,,,,
Pippilotta111,32,Aug-16,Aug-16,40,Interesting museum,"I wanted to know more about the history and the people of Singapore and this museum will enlighten you. It starts with the rock and ends with today. I have learned lots of things I didn't know before and history is presented in photographs, objects of the period, news reels and texts. For example there is a news reel of the surrender of the British to the Japanese and the table where they have signed, is there in the museum after you have seen it in a news reel. What I found very interesting to see is how they have forged together all these different nationalities into one people and how hard they have worked to achieve this and how proud they are of their accomplishments. There is also a reel with Lee Kuan Yew and you see how young he is and also how charismatic. I had heard his name before and now I know something more about his legacy. I can recommend this museum as you will understand the city and its people much better and where they come from."
,,,,,,
Alice C,473,Aug-16,May-16,40,Enjoyable,"An enjoyable visit, the exhibition about Singapore history is very interesting. When I visited the museum, there was also the exhibition of the loan pieces from British Museum. An extra bonus indeed. The museum restaurant offers tasty food too, a good choice to take a rest and to sate your hunger."
,,,,,,
Jay B,186,Aug-16,Aug-16,30,Abbreviated history of Singapore,The setting for this museum is spectacular in itself however unfortunately not enough of the building is on show. The museum is very well presented and provides a run down of the Malay Peninsular right through to independence for the  Singapore state. There is very limited number of original artefacts to complement the displays - however there are numerous replicas and all is laid out in a very imaginative way. I spent around 2 hours here including a visit to the cafe. There are additional special exhibits which would take longer. I recommend if you are in the area and have some time to spare.

Bram W,76,Aug-16,Jul-16,40,Not as good as it used to be but still excellent,I feel that their past (about 7 years ago) permanent exhibitions tend to be better.

Hopefully I could be in town when there is an exciting temporary exhibition held or when the Cinematheque has a good array of screenings.

srnwood,378,Jul-16,Jul-16,50,"Modern, interactive, and beautiful","So much I could say about this incredible museum.  I'm just going to share two examples from my visit:  1)  The Social Table.  At the National Gallery, before entering any of the art exhibits, I stood at a large table with moving photos of various art works in the collection.  It was a wonderful way to preview and familiarize yourself with the displayed originals.  You could touch the screen and learn all about the piece, the artist, the school. . . It made viewing the gallery a personal experience.  I'd turn a corner or enter a new room and immediately recognize one of ""my"" pieces.<br/>     But that's not all. <br/>     Also at the social table, you could tag the works you liked.  For example, I started a file on Women in Singaporean Art.  With a simple touch, I saved images in my folder.  AND THEN I was able to open my folder and CREATE a poster of the works I selected.  THIS I emailed to myself. <br/>2)  Children's art.  This interactive feature was in the Children's section of the Museum.  Titled ""Who's in the Woods?"" it invited children to design and them bring to life an animal.  I went with four year-old Lauren who was perfectly able to design her elephant.<br/>Once Lauren was happy with her creation, she could send it to live in the woods.  It would appear on the enormous screen, walking, sitting, and interacting with other animals.  I loved this.  So did Lauren.  She loved it so much, she created another animal, then another, and another.  The woods were full of her colorful inventions.<br/>Actually, I loved this exhibit so much, I created my own sweet elephant.  She had a plaid bow on her head. <br/>      And if all of that wasn't enough, when I got home and logged in to my gmail, a 3-D copy of my elephant was waiting for me to cut out and assemble."
,,,,,,
Deborah K,79,Jul-16,Jul-16,40,Well presented history,Beautiful building.  The walk thru Singapore's historical timeline is stylishly presented.  We had gone to Malacca a few days prior and were disappointed with the quality and general lack of exhibits in the museums there.  Found everything missing in Malacca in the Singapore Museum which was a pleasant surprise.  My 10 year old son was fascinated by the WWII displays and spent quite a long time taking in every detail.  Not too large so could squeeze in several other sights that day.

Leena D,15,Jul-16,Jul-16,40,Pretty cool! Very well-thought out.,"Very large! Would dedicate a solid 2-3 hours to this, or if you're a big history nut, the entire day. I honestly didn't know anything about Singapore before entering this building, but I came out with a newer appreciation for the short but compelling history. It's very organized and deliberately planned in that you walk in and start at the beginning, and then walk out in a room that highlights modern Singapore. There are also several themed rooms with things like, ""growing up in Singapore,"" or ""women's history."" It's quite cool.<br/><br/>There's also a $5 if you're a student (works for international students too - just make sure to bring your school ID)."

Philip S,8,Jul-16,Jul-16,40,Great way to get an understanding of Singapore,"Visiting this museum gave me an insight into how Singapore has become such a great modern nation. I was particularly interested in the post-war period, but the museum goes back many hundreds of years. A great day out."

The exhibits use all the modern perks to engage you, videos and listening options (that actually work) throughout. In addition to the regular exhibits there were several interactive stations that I'm assuming rotate with what is offered. Our children (3 and 10 months) really enjoyed the children's area and our 7 year old son was able to glean more information than he normally can by listening to the different exhibits."

CampbellJohn,77,Jul-16,Jul-16,50,A must see to understand Singapore,I visited the Museum for a couple of hours last Saturday before heading for the airport. The building itself is an attraction...tasteful modern architecture blended into a classical colonial period site. The exhibitions are an excellent way to understand Singaporean history and the multi-ethnic culture of this jewel of South East Asia. The sections on the Japanese occupation and on Premier Lee are fascinating and moving...Premier Lee had incredible vision; the world needs more leaders like him! Definitely worth a visit.

MICHAELJC59,172,Jul-16,Jul-16,40,A well structured journey,I was very pleasantly surprised - this museum is one of many in singapore but if you take the time to read at all the exhibits you will walk away richer for the experience

HD_Lew,318,Jul-16,Jun-16,40,Everything about Singapore,"The museum is a bit far away from the train station and it will be good if to have a map with you if you are planning to walk there.Alternatively, you can take a bus from the train station to there.<br/><br/>there are several exhibitions in the museum on Singapore's history as well as a special exhibition which require additional ticket fees.<br/><br/>you can visit other museums around the vicinity such as the Singapore Art Museum (walking distance) or take a bus or train to Asian Civilisation Museum."

WorldTourer,33,Jul-16,Jul-16,20,Overrated ,"This was a poor museum. It's very clean and well kept, however I thought the museum was not very good value for money at all. We payed $10 Singapore dollars each to get in and, frankly, the museum wasn't up to par to most FREE museums I've been too!<br/><br/>Completely overrated. It has 4 floors - a basement level, level 1, 2 and 3. Out of these 4 floors, 2 of them weren't even open for us to see and explore. Waste of time and money"

David B,330,Jul-16,Jul-16,50,Terrific museum,"This museum provides an excellent overview of Singapore's history.  I really enjoyed the section on the Japanese occupation during WW2, which included many artifacts and stories from that difficult period. I also liked the sections on Singapore's development after WW 2.<br/><br/>The building has a beautiful atrium and several brides were having wedding pics taken during my visit."

Jason G,51,Jul-16,Apr-16,50,Excellent Facility and Helpful Staff,I was in Singapore over a holiday weekend and decided to get out and walk to some of the local attractions.  I didn't know what to expect from a National Museum and was pleasantly surprised with the quality.  For a U.S. Citizen it was an amazing opportunity to learn about the history of Singapore and especially meaningful to review the exhibits on the Japanese occupation of Singapore during WWII.  I could not have received the same experience just reading a book.  The exhibits are very well prepared.<br/><br/>I was fortunate to visit while a British Museum display was on site.  The pieces from all over the world were amazing!!

Leela S,51,Jul-16,Jul-16,50,Interesting way to tell the history,History of Singapore was nicely displayed. It's lively and interactive to apply visual technology into the display. Story of commoners were impressively included. The fee is decent.

Jana M,59,Jul-16,Jun-16,50,Wonderful way to begin a city's visit,"My first trip to Singapore, so I chose a visit to the museum to begin my stay.  The English tour that morning gave me lots of good background information on the city/state's history that provided a solid background for the rest of my exploration of the city.  Informative, entertaining, and air conditioned.  ;-)"

JLotsos,399,Jul-16,Jul-16,50,What a Grand Building,"We took the kids here and they had a fabulous time. There was interactive things for the children and the building and place was amazing. It is quite expensive to get in, and there is not as much artwork as other museums in Europe but it is worth visiting just to see the building itself."

PieBerry248,46,Jul-16,Mar-16,40,Great place to learn about Singapore's history,"My school brought me to the National Museum to learn more about Singapore's history and to complete a worksheet. My group saw all kinds of things that we didn't know of! We saw the Singapore Stone with the strange carvings, for example. The museum was well made and the exhibitions were also nice. Recommended for history and culture lovers."

howiej51,23,Jul-16,Jul-16,50,Singapore History Gallery and Life in Singapore Galleries.,The museum is housed in a magnificent colonial building which has recently been renovated. The exhibition is well laid out and gives an excellent insight into the history of Singapore from the beginning. I got in as a senior for $5 which was such good value for money! Had brunch which was also excellent value for money. The staff were very polite and helpful which is the norm in Singapore from my experience. I recommend this visit highly!
,,,,,,
Khuen,210,Jun-16,Apr-16,40,Very informative trip,"There is a charge of $10 for non-singaporeans. Have throughly enjoy the museum especially the free guided tours, it is available in English, Mandarin, Japanese daily on certain timings. They even offered French and Korean guided tours monthly. My personal favourite is the Treasures of the world and it is absolutely a must to join the free tour for a detailed explanation on the artifacts. Do note that Singaporeans adult need to pay $14 while students get to go in free. Be prepared to spend at least 3 hours in total."
,,,,,,
Carolyn L,110,Jun-16,Feb-16,50,Excellent collection,"I visited the Museum specifically to see the ""Treasures"" exhibition from the British Museum, which was wonderful.   I was very pleasantly surprised by the permanent exhibitions also and learned a lot about the history of Singapore.   Very well presented - I particularly enjoyed the historic footage of the first Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew, announcing independence.  The Museum is definitely worth a visit, I enjoyed it very much."

burgertrut,43,Jun-16,Jun-16,40,Nice design and informative,"British museum exhibit was interesting, especially the tour (from marina) was VERY good and i recommend to anyone! The rest of the museum was typical of Asian National musea, a bit propaganda and history but not really art or cool artefacts. Lots of screaming kids in the hall and not such a good cafe, dirty water, 'European' food and bored staff. Very nice building. Overpriced (20$) but i would gladly pay this for the tour."

Julia N,148,Jun-16,Jul-15,50,"I'm not a big fan of Museums, but this one was AWESOME","I was very lucky to visit exhibition dedicated to the Father of Singapore - Lee Kuan Yew. There were some events held on the first floor: wedding reception in one hall, Leading Ladies of Singapore in the second hall, the History of the MovieMaking in the third hall and the Modern architectural PhotoExhibition in the fourth. The cute cafe was inviting with the smell of the fresh coffee and pastries. I think it's a perfect place for date. On the second floor it was a big exposition about life of an extraordinary pearson, who always worked at himself and never gave up. I LOVEd the museum and the love and RESPECT to life that you see in every detail, HOW people around care about that place. It was May and I noticed a box in the middle of the museum with the envelopes. Everyone could write down the letter to their mothers and the museum would send worldwide the letters for free. I wrote to my mom in Ukraine and she got it in 3 weeks! It was the best museum experience in my life."

Daidyte,56,Jun-16,Jun-16,50,Meet Singapore,"Singapore has quite an interesting history to be learned and probably the best way to do it is to visit the National Museum. It has quite interesting permanent history exhibit. If you are a thorough reader it can take time.. But almost every piece displayed there has a story behind written so it is interesting to read. I've spent there about 4-5 hours and I liked it. It is a good way to spend a hot or rainy day inside with conditioning. There was also a temporary exhibit of Treasures of the British Museum. It was small but the pieces are priceless (from all around the world),"
,,,,,,
ever_pasaway,131,Jun-16,Jun-16,40,You won't be bored,"This is my type of museum. There are so many exhibits to see with state of the art galleries that can entertain you for an afternoon. It's open at 10am and there is a fee for foreigners depending on which tours you want to see. Check their website for more info.<br/><br/>For a country so young, Singapore has a very diverse and rich history. National Museum of Singapore is just a glimpse. <br/><br/>1 hour passed by too quickly and we didn't get to see all the tours. Would have stayed longer if we weren't catching a movie. The Singapore Arts Museum is also close by."

Heng,"3,131",Jun-16,Feb-16,40,Well done with the upgrading ,"Haven't been here in ages and was pleasantly surprise with the upgraded look. Gone is the stark museum of yesteryear and in its place, themed galleries of different eras. I like the one with images and things of my childhood, brings back great memories; the one with Japanese occupation is great too as its images remind us the importance of national defense. <br/><br/>Well done with the upgrading."
,,,,,,
Amanda L,3,Jun-16,Jun-16,50,Very interesting history of Singapore,"If you go to this museum, definitely take advantage of the guided tour which comes at no extra cost. We had a great guide named Chong today who pieced all the exhibits and artefacts into a story about how Singapore came to be today, which was much more interesting than just looking at the descriptions! After the tour we were able to walk back and linger on sections we were into. Highly recommended!!"

Steven R,104,Jun-16,Jun-16,50,Great Place for Learning About Japanese Occupation and Split from Malaysia,This is a great museum for history. It is very strong on the split of Singapore from Malaysia and the Japanese occupation of Singapore in WWII. On these two crucial topics this museum is the top place in the world.

MegahYang,70,Jun-16,May-16,50,good weekend visit for a singapore resident like me,"somehow the songs of cicadas paintings by Chua Ek Kay still stuck in my mind. i love the local artist's collections, and the free tour guide which got the tour to be very interesting. She is passionate about what she do. i begin to appreciate art and paintings more because of her. i would definitely come back again. the view from the top overlooking Marina Bay Sands is quite stunning."
,,,,,,
Jonathan R,81,Jun-16,May-16,50,I'm not even a museum person and I liked this one,"This is a great place to learn about Singapore's history. It is not large and boring, but instead just the right size to spend 15 min or so in each room, learning about that slice of Singapore's history. Plenty of exhibits. I didn't bother with the British Museum portion of the museum, because I personally didn't really care to see the stuff that the British plundered from Singapore. I wanted to see what the locals found valuable. Nice exhibits and not crowded. Plus easily accessible from public transportation."
,,,,,,
Caliente62,247,Jun-16,Jun-16,40,Interesting,"History of Singapore shown in fascinating detail. It manages to be both historical and thorough without being laboured and dull.<br/>Great value for money if escaping the humidity, heat or rain!"

Lovesoul,105,Jun-16,May-16,50,So enlightening,"I loved this museum.  I really didn't know much about Singapore history.  I took the free, one hour guided tour, which was super helpful, and gave a great overview.  Then, I spent a couple of hours on my own.  I learned a lot, and found the exhibits really well laid out.  The explanations on the walls were really helpful.  I'm over 60, so I even got a great discount.  I took the MRT there, and just had to walk a few blocks.  There was a bus stop outside, and there was a bus that dropped me off right in front of my hotel. The guy at the front desk looked it up and gave me the bus numbers to take.  I highly recommend this museum."
,,,,,,
Michael F,141,Jun-16,Jun-16,40,Super visit,"I finally got around to visiting the National Museum after several trips to Singapore. After a wonderful (if humid) stroll through Fort Canning Park, the Museum offered a woderfully cool distraction. The History of Singapore section was nicely put together and informative. The temporary exhibition via the Bristis Museum was dull to be honest (personal opinion) but we had a good lunch and a further stroll around this impressive structure."

Graeme M,40,Jun-16,Jun-16,50,An excellent Museum,There are unique items here that are a must see. Be sure to include the exhibits in the supreme court building that are now part of the Museum.

Ctan1965,675,Jun-16,Jun-16,50,Re-acquaintance with the new national museum,"2pm the guided tour of 1 hour started with volunteer Hui Lin. She was informative and reminded what it means to be Singaporean. Of course there is the British history exhibition as well in the 2nd floor which is interesting too. From 1570 to 1800s you have history of Sir Stamford to William Faqhuar. For me the real founder/starter of the place is William rather than Raffles. It's just more romantic with Raffles. <br/>Within the buildings they have done a complete covered of the ""outdoor"" areas into air-conditioned play area and street side cafe served by Food for thought. And it has enough or something for everyone food wise.    I enjoyed the quality of the museum and the shop as well. The entry was free of charge for Singaporean and PR and more if you included the British exhibits."

Alasdair E,148,Jun-16,Jun-16,40,Excellent introduction to the history of Singapore,I enjoyed this museum and found the early history and wartime section particularly good.

Aussiegal15,541,Jun-16,Jun-16,50,WONDERFUL HISTORY OF SINGAPORE,"We spent a couple of hours at this lovely old, but fully renovated Museum last Sunday. We loved reading about the History of Singapore and we managed in that time to only finish the ground floor Exhibition.  Next time we visit Singapore, we will return and go to the 2nd floor for the remainder of the Exhibition. It is well worth a visit."
,,,,,,
moniker11,440,Jun-16,Jun-16,50,Great information in a brilliantly curated presentation,You get quite a full history of Singapore that is laid out in an intriguing way with lots of interactive displays as well as variations in the presentations. You can move from pictures to maps to animations to dioramas and on to video and solid objects. It's what every museum ought to be doing. Well done!

8nlssy,320,Jun-16,Jun-16,40,New landmark with great potential,"South East Asia is in need of a well-managed museum in the likes of the MET, the Vienna museum, the Bostonian  and the British museum- so when the National Museum of Singapore  opened it was greeted with delight and encore.<br/><br/>Covering close to three floors, the National Museum of Singapore showcases its history and that of some its SEA neighbours. The Treasures exhibition held in conjunction with the British Museum is also worthy of a visit.<br/><br/>There are loads of activities  for children as well and also survey forms for the visitors to give feedback. <br/><br/>The museum  staff must be congratulated for their efforts on encouraging children's  participation in the activities within the museum; audio, viewing movies, drawing and colouring. It was such a joy to see families being able to managed the kids well within the confines of this beautiful museum.<br/><br/>There are two restaurants; Flutes and Food for Thought. I love the gardens and marvel at how well kept the museum is. Great effort has been put into this. Keep it up!!!<br/><br/>Prices at the entrance could be lower."

R1138,99,Jun-16,Jun-16,10,"free for locals, foreigners must pay","I didn't enjoy my visit to this museum much. You have to queue behind a pillar and can't see the prices and choices of ticket, so everyone has to work out at the desk what they want - would be better to have it displayed on the wall so you can decide while queueing. Then you would not spend 5 min in a queue to get your ticket. <br/>They could not explain why foreigners pay S$10 but singapore residents get in for free (a practice that I don't agree with).<br/>Some parts of singapore's history seem a bit glossed over - for example why they split with Malaysia got very little (almost no) mention. From what I read on wikipedia singapore was expelled from malaysia and that was certainly not mentioned.<br/>The building was nice though, with a modern annexe attached to the old building, a good example of how to make use of an old building."

VeraChiu21,222,Jun-16,May-16,40,Superb museum!,"Honestly, I wouldn't have came here, if it wasn't for the free ticket to go to the British Museum exhibition (I went to the National Gallery and brought a ticket for all the exhibition.  They said I could see this British Museum exhibition for free).  I only went to this museum and the National Gallery in Singapore, they are both very big and impressive, in terms of the architecture.  <br/>The British Museum exhibition is good if you haven't seen the 'real thing' in Britain.  It is a smaller version of that.  It's good if it's for free.  They are all detailed and there are a lot of art/exhibits from different countries and eras. <br/>I did not see any other of the exhibits, but again, I enjoyed walking around the museum."

bernadette972015,38,Jun-16,May-16,50,Pristine and Informative,"A pristine (like everything in Singapore!) museum in an incredibly beautiful building.  The museum was so large we only visited the history of Singapore exhibit, which was detail oriented, engaging, colorful, and very informative.  We joined a group tour and the guide was excellent, though the exhibits are easily marked and you could pass through them on your own and still learn a lot.  We were very impressed."

This being our third visit to Singapore we were keen to learn more about the nation and its history.  The museum takes you on a journey through history to the present day with informative and engaging exhibits that use a blend of visual art, technology and facts to convey the message.  We spent half a day and could easily have stayed several hours more.  Recommend exiting at the top level and wandering through Fort Canning park afterward."

jasontancheeleng,63,Jun-16,Jun-16,40,A must for everyone,Good atmosphere for all to learn abt the history of Singapore. A few hours is not enough.

RITravelinFool,30,Jun-16,May-16,50,Intersting History,"I enjoyed the museum a lot - it gave a great overview of the history of Singapore, putting a lot of things in context for me.  I didn't do the temporary exhibit (quite a bit more money for what looked like similar art to what I've seen in other museums - Louvre, Ufizi Gallery, Met and MOMA) which might be worthwhile if you don't get to visit other larger museums and have more time to spend.  I did the permanant collection in about 75 minutes."

ivang1950,297,May-16,May-16,50,Excellent Story of the Formation and Politics of Singapore,"A good museum with lots of exhibits documenting the rise of Singapore from the early trading days through its days under British administration, under Japanese occupation, as a colony and finally an independent state after a short spell as part of Malaysia. Very well laid out and informative well worth a few hours. The ground floor is more traditional with the upper floor set out as individual rooms covering different time periods. Concessions available for seniors."

SvetAndAli,130,May-16,May-16,40,Singapore's History in one place,"Beautiful building on the outside, which combined modern and victorian style structures within. We only went to the history of Singapore section of the Museum, but spent a good 2-3 hours in there, exploring Cingapora's history from it's origins to present day. A must if you want to find out more about the place!"
,,,,,,
My_chicken_and_I,99,May-16,May-16,50,Singapore then and now,The thing that stood out to me the most when I went there was the difference from back in the day to present day Singapore.  It sure has come a long way in a short span of time.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a look and plan to spend at least two to three hours there.
,,,,,,
Gazal P,982,May-16,May-16,50,Treasures of the World exhibit,We went only for the Treasures of the World exhibition gallery and its totally worth the entry price. Remember to carry your HSBC credit card if you have one. That buys you the cheapest ticket at $10 each. Cheaper than even the child/student discount. Saw Egyptian artefacts now after seeing them in the Cairo Museum. Awesome mummy!
,,,,,,
Fajaretta,52,May-16,May-16,50,A to Z Singapore,"If you love spend a whole day in museum, this place suits you. To go around a whole museum you must spend at least 3-4 hours. This museum brings you the history of Singapore from A to Z. Again, you will be amazed how Singaporean preserve their history and culture."

Emilia M,214,May-16,May-16,50,"Fantastic Museum, Fantastic Building","The museum building is just wonderful, the way the museum is set up is very impressive and also very logical in the way it takes you through the SG history. Don't miss the upper section where they have rooms set up in different history periods where you can get a great feel for what was happening in SG at the time."
,,,,,,
echidnatrip,59,May-16,Apr-16,50,Surprisingly enjoyable.,It was fascinating to see how much Singapore has changed. The difference between Singapore and Malaysia is also marked. Educational and well worth the $10 admission fee.
,,,,,,
thoughtfulpebble,743,May-16,Dec-15,50,More interesting than I was expecting,"You might think Singapore has not been around that long, so the national museum is not going to be interesting, but actually it is. It starts in pre-history and goes all the way up to near present-day. The historical footage of Lee Kwan Yew getting very emotional during the split from Malaysia is unexpectedly moving."
,,,,,,
martyna_polska,192,May-16,May-16,50,Must see place for those who have no idea about Singapore!,"And also for those who want to refresh or broaden their knowledge. The museum is really modern - my favourite part is the historical one, you need 1-1,5 hour to walk through the historical part and to see and read everything - and it;s worth it! History of SG is depicted in a very clear manner. I usually attend free guided tours, I did so here as well but the museum itself has so many additional features and the guide goes to quickly, so I think in this case it's actually better to wander around alone, although our guy was an educated and nice gentleman."
,,,,,,
Placido,466,May-16,Apr-16,40,Wonderful historical perspective about Singapore,We visited the Singapore National Museum early during our visit and we're pleased to have gone here.  Singapore is a truly amazing place with very progressive culture and governance. This museum explains how the nation was born and evolved.<br/><br/>The museum should be a must see for all history buffs or for anyone interested in learning the importance of a few key individuals in creating this amazing city state. It's inspirational to learn how 2 Visionary leaders good shape the fate of this community and ultimately transform a little fishing village into the fantastic country that we see today.<br/><br/>Dedicate about 2 hours to tour the museum and if possible try to catch one of the guided tours that are available for free. The museum entrance fee may be one of the best deals in this city.

wenrobbo,84,May-16,May-16,40,Understanding Singapore,"I found this museum really informative. My parents lived in Singapore in the 1950s and I had my first couple of years there until we left in 1960. I find the country amazing in all it has achieved. I agree, the LKY speech when Singapore broke away from Malaysia is extremely touching. I recommend that all visitors to Singapore should visit the museum and gain a sense of Singapore's history and how it values racial and spiritual diversity."
,,,,,,
Sam K,36,May-16,May-16,50,Brilliant venue to understand the mosaic of Singapore,"For anyone interested in the history of Singapore, a visit to the museum is a must.<br/>The building itself is very welcoming and the timeline museum layout takes you from the beginnings when early settlers have appeared, thro the colonial past, the WWII and finally post colonial period. There is an excellent tv footage of the moving LKY speech towards the exit which should not be missed.<br/>There are maps, paintings, pictures, old film footage as well as old guns and articles to give a good background to how the mosaic of modern Singapore came together."
,,,,,,
Hak18,78,May-16,Apr-16,10,With kids ,"A big let down given all the hype. Kids were bored to death! Impressive exterior but felt ""hollow"" inside. Not a family type museum. No family friendly affordable restaurants either. The children's play area was pitiful. Should really learn from the more interesting Australian museums."

Henry W,30,May-16,Oct-15,40,Place to understand Singapore,The most touched scene is LKY's speech.<br/>Because of his contribution that Singapore become an organized and diversity country.

LoveToTraval,311,May-16,Apr-16,40,Great Historical Perspective,"This was our first trip to Singapore and I knew very little about the history. The museum presents many exhibits dating back to the very early years of existence. I came away with an understanding of the multicultural influence of this wonderful island country.  In some parts, a little more signage could be useful. Overall, it was a really good experience, highly recommended."

Yurina S,58,May-16,Apr-16,50,Interactive museum,It was a nice place to visit. We joined a guided tour and it was very interesting to get to know about the history of Singapore. My kids got plenty to see and touch without getting in trouble :-)
,,,,,,
Bigpetesol,103,Apr-16,Apr-16,50,Well worth the visit,"A very good museum, well laid out, with good exhibits and in a very nice colonial building. Thought the entry fee of $25 was a bit steep, but we did get to see the traveling exhibit from the British Museum included for that price."
,,,,,,
John O,41,Apr-16,Apr-16,50,Outstanding Museum,The museum is outstanding and focuses on Singapore history and life in Singapore.  Recommend spending two days at four hours each day if you want to see everything.
,,,,,,
Paulgvss,17,Apr-16,Apr-16,50,Fascinating history tour,My visit was solely at the request of my wife but a guided tour that lasted over two hours convinced me that this is an essential highlight for Singapore.<br/>Staff were helpful and passionate about their exhibitions and facility. And the wealth of knowledge about Singapore was perfect for a visitor - including pre colonial era (much more interesting)
,,,,,,
travelnonstop247,508,Apr-16,Apr-16,30,Basic history,"I enjoyed the special exhibit of items loaned from the British Museum as well as the permanent collection on Singapore's history. However, I wish the museum had a more exhaustive collection on colonialism in Singapore. I expected a little more on the 19th century history, including more artifacts. <br/><br/>The gift shop was also disappointing."
,,,,,,
juliaminsk86,5,Apr-16,Mar-16,50,Helpful to understand about Singapore,This museum is really beautiful and help you understand clearly about Singapore. A nice country. We spent half of the day here and definitely worth a visit.

Austin_TexasRedhead,167,Apr-16,Apr-16,40,Excellent indoor activity - for those hot or rainy days,"Great retrospective of Singapore's long history as a trade area and colony into current day.  Interesting objects on display such as a Revere Bell donated by Paul Revere's daughter, paintings, history of Chinese gangs, and even an opium bed.  Traveling exhibit from British Museum was in basement, great collection of items from all over the world."
,,,,,,
Joe E,9,Apr-16,Apr-16,50,A good starting point to understand help understand Singapore,The museum is a beautiful building that is a blend of modern and colonial architecture. It is a really well done trip through time to understand how Singapore become what it is today. <br/><br/>During my visit was an exhibit of pieces from British museums which was also quite comprehensive.
,,,,,,
SSPeng,49,Apr-16,Apr-16,50,700 years of Singapore's history in a single visit,"Singapore's oldest museum has been beautifully restored. Lovely selection of artefacts. Whether is it to a walk down memory lane or rediscover some lesser known aspects of Singapore history, there's certainly new things to discover."
,,,,,,
Daniel C,136,Apr-16,Apr-16,30,Ok.  Good summary of history.,"The History of Singapore portion was interesting for a quick summary, but it's hard to encapsulate history without trivializing, and perhaps even mislead.  It was good to see artifacts from the different periods, particularly the collection on Chinese secret societies, and the collections representing aspects of Singaporean life in the upstairs exhibits.  <br/><br/>I'd recommend reading a book or short history primer while you're in your home country instead, and pop in if you happen to be in the area than a dedicated stop."
,,,,,,
Ferne_NZ,199,Apr-16,Mar-16,50,A lovely place to visit,I really enjoyed my visit to the gallery.  Not too many other visitors meant you could see the exhibits easily.   Very well arranged and good mixture of statues and paintings.  Great art from around Asia.  Very full of light and life.

03Val48,560,Apr-16,Mar-16,50,Good Historical Summary,"We arrived just as a free tour was starting, and while we could have visited on our own and read about each of the displays, this was a quick and easy way to see the highlights of the collection.  This museum is a great introduction to the recent history of Singapore and should be on every visitor's list.  It is modern, well organized, and gives a quick understanding of the important events that have shaped this modern city."
,,,,,,
Bill N,329,Apr-16,Apr-16,50,Very educational,Good historical and social history of Singapore over the past 100 years or so. Allow 2-4 hours for this visit. Easy to follow route through the museum.

blondebass1622,274,Apr-16,Mar-16,50,Excellent History Lesson of Singapore,"I did not know much at all about the history of the country, and the museum goes back a couple hundred years so you get a good sense of the region and what was going on leading up to the formation of Singapore.  Great exhibits!"
,,,,,,
OTT12,327,Apr-16,Apr-16,40,Interesting to see.,"The main exhibition area covers a short history of Singapore from ancient times to British colonial, and up to the present time.<br/>Interesting and informative without beeing overpowering .<br/>The additional bonus at the moment is the exhibition held in collaboration with the British Museum which has pieces Greece Egypt, Asia, Americas etc."
,,,,,,
Steven R,11,Apr-16,Apr-16,40,A Nice Way to Spend 3 Hours.,"We went here and saw all of the exhibits and came away with a lot of knowledge and respect for Singapore.

,,,,,,
ktcj85,17,Apr-16,Apr-16,50,A must visit place.,"The museum showcase the history of singapore very well.The exhibits were fantastic some were also interactive. The museum guides and staff are very knowledgeable. As you walk through the museum, you will really feel like you are travelling back in time. As the exhibits are quite extensive and there are several galleries, do allocate at least half a day if you plan to visit the museum."

Hafkiwi,590,Apr-16,Apr-16,50,Best to do at the start of your trip,"Wish we'd done this tour early on. It was wonderful to see and hear all about the struggles Singapore had over many years. Very informative and well played out. Didn't get lost at all. Only about$18 Sgd ( senior fee), bargain. The small, but wonderful, treasures of the world exhibit(ends 29 May) was well worth it as well. It's another gorgeous building, spotless. Many helpful guides as well. We spent 3 hours on a cloudy, hot day in perfect A/c temps. Def a must do...."
,,,,,,
Shanghailiz,144,Apr-16,Apr-16,50,Beautifully done ,"Spent an enjoyable 3 hours wandering around today - visited the small but excellent Treasures of the World exhibition and the 100 years of Singapore History gallery. <br/><br/>The treasures from the British Museum were indeed from all over the globe. What an interesting selection. From Australia, Africa, Middle East,  Europe, America - with many artifacts from Polynesia and Micronesia too.<br/><br/>The History of Singapore was very well done - displays/audio/visual. From its formation to modern times with emphasis on the Raffles era and up to the end of the Second World War. <br/><br/>Did not have time to do the top floor justice <br/>- but will make another visit next time I am back."

peterandpam2011,34,Apr-16,Mar-16,50,Very Imaginative And Informative Museum,"We spent a couple of very interesting hours in this fine museum. The displays are extensive and imaginative, and cover a wide range of Singapore's history. These set the development of the island from ancient times to the present day, using a wide variety of physical recreations, artifices, and images. A very worthy National Museum, suitable for all ages."
,,,,,,
Carmen C,34,Apr-16,Apr-16,50,Best Ever with a tour guide,A must see with a tour guide. We had a very informative tour guide who also answered questions on culture and politics. The story telling brings you back in time. I learned so much about Singapore from the local point of view.

S_andra21_12,11,Apr-16,Mar-16,50,Really interesting trip thru Singapore history,We spent a couple of hours here going through all the galleries.<br/>We particularly enjoyed going through the rooms devoted to the history of Singapore.<br/>We used the MRT and the bus to get there - was really easy.
,,,,,,
David G,10,Apr-16,Apr-16,50,Intriguing step back in time...,"Housed in an incredible colonial style building, the NMS brings together the past and present of Singapore in a way that is both interactive and fun. Definitely pay the extra to see the 'Treasures of the World' exhibition-- so many cool artifacts from the ancient world, even non museum lovers will be mesmerized."
,,,,,,
Gunner127,60,Apr-16,Apr-16,30,An interesting insight into Singapore's history,The museum is located in a magnificent building located in the centre of the city. It includes a section covering the history of the island which is well laid out and informative. Well worth a visit for an hour or two.
,,,,,,
JeiGee,182,Apr-16,Mar-16,30,Best place to learn the history of Singapore,"If you are a tourist or first time living in Singapore, this should be your first place to visit above anything else. You will learn how this country was formed and how this country became a multicultural nation."
,,,,,,
Europelover2014,"2,077",Apr-16,Apr-16,50,Glad we came,We were impressed last year with a very basic exhibit of Singapore history being shown as the museum was being renovated.  I'm so glad we could return to see the new exhibits in the renovated museum.  Very impressive depiction of Singapore history.  Worth a return on the next visit.  We spent two hours and wanted more.<br/><br/>We were disappointed in the special exhibit of British Museum artifacts.  Items taken out of context and simply displayed is not my idea of a curator's job.
,,,,,,
Gloria B,711,Apr-16,Apr-16,50,Wonderful Exhibits,"The special exhibit ""Treasures"" from the British Museum is spectacular and well worth visiting.  The artifacts from ancient civilizations from Rome to China are of the finest examples of jewelry, sculpture, pottery and religious relics.  There is also a tour of the History of Singapore exhibit that is worthwhile to learn about the development of the city from a fishing village, through the 2nd world war to modern times.  There are restaurants and a small gift shop in the air conditioned building that has a modern wing attached to the original Colonial building."
,,,,,,
The2Olds,105,Apr-16,Apr-16,40,Very good museum,Lots to see here and plenty of information about the history of Singapore. Worth a visit to stroll through the galleries. Plenty of seats to sit and admire the displays from.
,,,,,,
ElleGee1208,46,Apr-16,Mar-16,40,"The British Museum exhibits are a ""Priceless' must do.",First of all the National Museum building is architecturally so stunning. <br/>There was the most fabulous photo exhibits displayed...each photo was soul stirring. I am unsure of how often the exhibits change.<br/>The British Museum exhibits from around the world are stunning...<br/>I thought the focus lighting on these priceless exhibits could have been much brighter. It was a bit difficult to read because it was too dark.<br/>It's highly recommended even if you are not crazy about museums.
,,,,,,
Victoria S,71,Apr-16,Apr-16,40,Great exhibition about the history of Singapore and very nice cafe too,We only went to the exhibition about the history of Singapore (which you had to pay to see and I believe is only temporary) but this was worth it if you are interested in reading about the history of this region which we were. The cafe/restaurant in the museum was a pleasant surprise - amazing food (menu not counter food) which meant it was pricey - but worth it.

Ka Po N,32,Mar-16,Mar-16,50,So lucky to have a look of the treasures of the world ,"We went to the National Museum of Singapore yesterday.  Certainly,  we could get to know more about the history of Singapore there.  Out of my expectation,  there over 200 treasures from the British museum being exhibited there.  We saw a mummy and many other treasures from all over the world.  The visitors could take photos of the exhibits without flash.  The exhibition will last till mid-May 2016."

AngelaTh,351,Mar-16,Mar-16,40,A comprehensive history of Singapore,This museum provides a comprehensive history of Singapore. It has quite a bit on the occupation but it is the later events surrounding its gaining independence which I found particularly interesting. Easily accessible by MRT this is definitely a must-visit if you want to find out more about Singapore.

foulaman,309,Mar-16,Feb-16,50,Great Focus on Singapore History,"This is a wonderful museum in a beautifully restored building, with a strong focus on Singapore's history.  Don't miss the room showing Singapore life during WWII, This facility has both permanent exhibits as well as temporary exhibitions from time to time.  Keep in mind Singapore museums offer a considerably-reduced entry fee for tourist seniors."
,,,,,,
LeesaSoulodre,194,Mar-16,Apr-15,50,An excellent location to enjoy local history,"The National Museum of Singapore, located across the road from Singapore Management University is an iconic building that you must visit. Enjoy the local speciality exhibitions or relax with a latte over a great book in the downstairs cafe. A must visit. Lifts for strollers but wear a carrier if you are seeing an exhibition. Some of the formats are not made for ease of viewing or with the crowds - travelling."

bobndee24,446,Mar-16,Feb-16,40,Good Overview of History of Singapore,They did a good job describing the origins of the country....very interesting.  In the basement there was a travelling display available at additional cost.

swans11,298,Mar-16,Mar-16,50,A really interesting place to spend a few hours,"We were interested in seeing the museum's 'Treasures of the World from the British Museum' visiting exhibition, which had a good selection of  representative artefacts from all regions of the world. However the National Museum itself is well worth a visit at any time. The Singapore History Gallery on Level 1 is a visual walk through time from the early history of the region through to the modern city. Level 2 has several small permanent galleries on themes including including 'Growing Up' in Singapore the 1950's &amp; 60's and 'Surviving Syonan' about life during the Japanese Occupation in WW2. A really interesting Museum for both locals and foreigners and well worth visiting for a few hours."

Leonard C,101,Mar-16,Mar-16,40,Important Singapore Historical Insights,"The National Museum is located in a colonial dating from 1887 but has been beautifully restored with a modern addition in 2006.  The galleries tell the story of Singapore's history and culture.  There is an entry fee of 18 Singapore dollars. There was a special exhibit of treasures from the British Museum where we spent most of our time.  We did spend some time in the Singapore exhibits, that were extensive and detailed and requires hours to absorb all the information provided. There is a café on the premises."

HTraveller,315,Mar-16,Mar-16,40,worthwhile trip,Went there last Sunday the first time and had a good time there with the family. The museum is absolutely state of the art and give a very good overview of the history of Singapore. The special exhibition with treasures from the British Museum was a bit odd since the pieces were all pretty nice but put together in a bit of a random way. The kids enjoyed a story telling session that we was very well done. I have learned a lot about the short history of Singapore which was really insightful.
,,,,,,
Elina E,58,Mar-16,Mar-16,50,Interesting insight into the history of Singapore,This is a beautiful museum that you should visit to gain a better understanding of the history of Singapore.

Galib,884,Mar-16,Feb-16,40,Singapore at a glance!,"The museum is not very big but its good if you want to know Singapore at a glimpse. I was lucky because when I visited there during February 2016, a special show was running named 'Wonders of the World' with the collectibles from British Museum. It was great to see all the ancient artifacts of Greek, Egypt, Parisian and Inca civilizations. The main museum is also good with very nice representations of Singapore history, culture and development through artifacts and info-graphics. <br/>Liked the overall experience and would recommend to others as well."

ChooseyTraveler,76,Mar-16,Feb-16,30,Wonderful concept of melding two older buildings with glass and galleries featuring light but beware of  stairs,"The buildings are beautiful and even a non-architect like me could appreciate the feat of adding a huge glass covering to unite these two very old stone buildings.  It is a unique experience to visit it and the tour is well worth the time and money.<br/><br/>However, two caveats:  there are many stairs and it's not always possible to use elevators to get from one place to another;  given all the space, I thought there were surprisingly few works of art displayed.  The latter may have been because they were redoing some areas and there other kinds of exhibits to see.<br/><br/>Still worth a visit while in Singapore."
,,,,,,
HAS_08,38,Mar-16,Mar-16,40,A good intro to Singapore ,"As someone who knew very little about the history of Singapore, this was a good intro for me. The exhibit on the first floor covers the entire history of the country. I did not have enough time to see the other exhibits."
,,,,,,
nick j,102,Mar-16,Mar-16,30,Dont visit until they have finished the refurb,"This museum has a lot of interesting material about Singapore history but todays visit was ruined for me by the fact that they were refurbishing the only cafe that could have sold me a drink and it was closed. So i arrived dehydrated and gasping for a soda only to find there was absolutely nothing available, which given the heat in Singapore is just unacceptable. So the $25 entry fee was pretty must wasted as I left after an hour to find a cafe."
,,,,,,
donna m,36,Mar-16,Mar-16,40,Beautiful melding of old and new architecture,Lovely repurposing of an older colonial building with a modern extension at the back.  Interesting galleries on Singapore history and life under the Japanese.  However light on history about prisoners of war in Singapore during WWII.
,,,,,,
Roshni2011,539,Mar-16,Feb-16,40,Very interesting and informative,"The musuem has several galleries and until May also a special exhibit from the British Museum. You could pay for either or buy a combined ticket which we did and it was worthwhile.<br/><br/>The British Museum exhibit was a selection of artifacts covering the globe, mostly ancient history -- a well chosen cross section, nicely written up and displayed.<br/><br/>The Singapore history and culture  galleries cover various eras  right up to the modern age and have been creatively put together -- a wide selection of exhibits has been painstakingly collected and displayed .<br/><br/>The Museum also has a good shop and restaurants -- we ate lunch at the cafe and it was excellent.<br/><br/>All in all, a very pleasant half day visit. And like everything else in Singapore, very well organized including great accessibility especially since I took my mother on a wheelchair."
,,,,,,
Kym_from_Perth,509,Mar-16,Sep-15,50,Highly recommend,"We were there on a day with free entry. I think it had just opened again after being shut for an extended period of time. Regardless, I would still pay to go in. The exhibitions were interesting and not too 'flat'. Lovely building too."
,,,,,,
Doreen M,221,Mar-16,Feb-16,50,Worthwhile visit,"There was a lot to cover in a very large, well laid out building. We only went to the Singapore history gallery and life in Singapore galleries. Plenty to see and discover.<br/>Good eating area."
,,,,,,
Mark T,5,Mar-16,Mar-16,40,History of Singapore,"This museum had the history of Singapore, from its basic beginnings as a trade hub for all the neighbouring countries, then to its Japanese invasion, its multiculturalism and mixed influences to how it came the city of today."
,,,,,,
CK61,169,Mar-16,Mar-16,30,The building is the star.,Okay so we have seen some of the best museums in the world and did not have great expectations for this one. The building is beautiful colonial architecture. The local history was adequately set out but in rather old fashioned static style. The visiting exhibit from the British Museum offered superb exhibits but was a small sample of artifacts and art.
,,,,,,
tropicalnorth,438,Mar-16,Jan-16,20,this is reviewing Treasure of British Museum ONLY,"Please note this is not a review for the museum as a whole but a warning to those thinking of buying a ticket to the Treasure of the British Museum. I would expect for the price that there would be a whole floor of exhibits. Instead it was 6 rooms of rather pedantic items. Living in Canada, I've seen great West Coast carvings and I've been lucky enough to see lots of Egyptian, Middle Eastern and South American treasures. The only thing that caught my eye was the Lewis ivory chess pieces and they only had TWO!<br/>If this is your first museum visit, you may enjoy it, but if you've been to any museum at all, then this exhibit is profoundly disappointing. <br/>The curator also didn't seem to have an overarching theme or idea outside of showcasing different parts of the world."
,,,,,,
Phil A,86,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,Currently have some interesting exhibitions,"Originally went to see the World Press Photography exhibition. Ended up staying most of day to see other exhibitions. Enjoyed their Treasures of the World from the British Museum, which was free if you were born in the Year of the Monkey (take proof). They have guided tours of exhibitions, check times and languages. Lovely, cool and calm inside the building."
,,,,,,
ArizonaArchitect,368,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,Great Start to A Singapore Visit,Spent a couple of hours in the museum. The building itself is rich in colonial history.  The displays present the history of Singapore in a way that a first time visitor can really get a grasp of this amazing city / state. Admission price was modest.
,,,,,,
iraa a,72,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,Beautiful and worth a visit,Contemporary art from Asia displayed in 2 beautifully restored historic buildings.  We enjoyed the architecture as much as we enjoyed the artwork.  The docents are mostly pensioners that enjoyed sharing their thoughts on the artists and were very proud of this newly opened museum.  Make sure you have a drink or meal on the 5th floor restaurant with the best skyline views of Singapore.
,,,,,,
Hilaryleach,113,Feb-16,Dec-15,50,Great place,This museum is really good and quite cheap. It is a great incite into the history of Singapore and has interesting exhibits.Clean toilets and good cafe.
,,,,,,
celebrationtiger,474,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,Not to be Missed,"If you want to understand anything about how Singapore came to be, do not miss this museum.  It tells the history in an interactive and delightful way.  The exhibition is recently completed and can be seen in an hour and a half."
,,,,,,
Adrian H,427,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,Singapore history well presented,"We enjoyed everything about the Museum, lots of interesting things for all ages and tell the history of Singapore in an excellent way."
,,,,,,
wananavu12,79,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,Modern Style themed museum,"This museum is housed in the original colonial museum and a modern purpose built additional wing. <br/><br/>Large open areas give a feeling of grandeur to the museum which walks you through the history of museum from early times through the various colonial eras, the war years and occupation by Japan and ultimately the rise of the modern Republic of Singapore. <br/><br/>A very interesting collection that when taken along with a couple of walking tours, gives you a good picture. The depiction of the occupation years are surprising in their subtlety with little mention of the atrocities of that period. <br/><br/>You will need a minimum of 2 hours to do it justice - we took 3 hours. There is an admission fee for foreigners."
,,,,,,
markrabjohns,277,Feb-16,Jan-16,40,Interesting Exhibitions,They normally have an interesting exhibition on here at any one time. Worth a visit because it is an interesting colonial building with a couple of nice cafes.
,,,,,,
Swikaar,77,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,"clean, peaceful, rich &amp; royal experience!!!","Flute Restaurant &amp; Bar is there, Singapore first private British Museum is there, gift shop stamp by Singapore National Museum."
,,,,,,
Harvey G,110,Feb-16,Jan-16,40,A Good Museum but Expect to Pay Multiple Admissions,This is a very comprehensive museum that try's to be too many things to too many people. They have special exhibits (which require a separate admission) and two permanent exhibits which feature another two admission prices. I recommend telling the people at the information counter how much time you would like to spend in the museum and asking them which admission you should pay. We just toured the main museum and there was plenty to see there. I found the exhibits on the Japanese occupation during WWII to be most interesting.  An especially good venue for a rainy day.
,,,,,,
bundeskanzler,86,Feb-16,Feb-16,30,"As the name says, it's the National museum...","Went here to see how Singapore as a city has developed. I didn't think it would have been different from how the nation did, but apparently it is. A lot of good exhibition items on wars, politicians and e.g. daily life. Less so about commerce or the city itself  (I actually learned more about the way the city has grown during a river boat cruise than a two hour visit here). On the good side: it's decently sized, with the Singapore section doable in two hours or less."
,,,,,,
mexikids,236,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,"Small, organized and well presented","Before entering this tastfully renovated colonial building, my family knew little about Singapore's history. The entrance fee was reasonable and there was a 50% senior citizens discount for my parents.<br/>Each room covers a distinct era of the city/state's history. My wife is a museum buff and said more than once that it was one of the best (if not THE best) history museums she's visitedin terms of presentation of information. <br/>Not only were there photographs and text (multiple languages) but there were multimedia, interactive, multi-sensory (even smells) included."
,,,,,,
dctravelexpat,110,Feb-16,Jan-16,30,No Parking at the National Museum of SIngapore,"Your visit to this museum should be more enjoyable if you do not bother driving there.  Their website states that limited parking is available.  I did provide feedback directly to the museum recommending the website be corrected to state that NO PARKING is available.  Even if you arrive before the museum opens, you'll find that the few parking spaces at the front of the building are all occupied by staff.<br/>The British Museum currently has an exhibit on loan in the basement.  The permanent collections provide a history of Singapore.<br/>This museum is well worth a brief visit and lunch at Food For Thought or Flutes, but if you hope to enjoy your visit, don't bother driving your car there."
,,,,,,
Andrew K,75,Feb-16,Feb-16,10,Terrible Lighting of Exhibits,"The lighting of the exhibits is very poor, you can hardly see the items. The cards will describe features in the items that you can not see because the lighting is so bad. I am sure that the items are interesting and many are beautiful, but it was a struggle to see the detail in most of the items."
,,,,,,
Ryan S,66,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,Superb - well worth a visit,"The National Museum was mentioned in a brochure about Singapore which I found at my Hotel. I believe it used to be a Library, but has refurbished as the National Museum. Great use of an older building, and so glad that they upgraded rather than demolished it. They've done an amazing job, and the layout and displays were amazing. In addition to the specialist exhibits, there was also a focus on Singapore's history through to present day which was a fascinating insight. If you have a few hours to spare, well worth a look."
,,,,,,
MeeraMc7,269,Feb-16,Jul-15,30,Lot of information to read,"When ever i travel to a country i tried to visit the meuseum. They provide you a electronic pad with information on each and every artifact displayed. I found this facinating at the beginning but there were 100 odd clips and i didn't have time to visit all the 100 and listen to the descriptions. i must say i had few good laughs when i saw few artifacts. One was the kenwood master chef, singer machine, telephone.. they have kept it in the museum and my mom still has this kenwood master chef. Also i have seen the other machine and the good old telephone in somnay households i vist. Singapore has come along way."

Marc M,377,Feb-16,Feb-16,40,Great overview of Singapore History,"This museum is very well done. Evidently there is an entire kids' floor, but unfortunately it was closed when we visited."
,,,,,,
Denz Aliwana,8,Feb-16,Feb-16,40,Singapore through the years,A very good place to know more of Singapore's past and how did these shaped the Singapore we know today. Very informative as the design and atmosphere will really bring you back to that era..
,,,,,,
CurlyTraveller,211,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,Big museum with permanent and temporary exhibits,"NMS belongs to the museums of Singapore that are worth checking out. The building is classical with contemporary additions. There are exhibits (permanent) that give you insights in Singapore's history and life. And of course there are temporary exhibits.<br/><br/>Sometimes they have movie showings outdoors, under a huge banyan tree.<br/><br/>I'm not impressed by the museum shop nor by the museum restaurant."
,,,,,,
AlnLes,198,Feb-16,Jan-16,50,So much to see and do,We visited the museum in January 2016.  What a superbly informative and interesting museum and a must visit place for visitors to Singapore.
,,,,,,
Bryuzga,"1,442",Feb-16,Apr-15,50,Exemplary museum,Impeccably organized and kept - as everything else in Singapore.<br/>I admired a tribute to late Lee Kuan Yew - a real founder of this country.<br/>As well as an exhibition of dresses.

DBfromKC,53,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,Museum of Singapore history is well worth the visit,"Excellent museum of Singapore's history.  As an American, I was embarrassingly ignorant of the country's history.  But Singapore's history is fascinating, especially its remarkable development in the last 50 years.   I really enjoyed this very well-done museum."
,,,,,,
Adeline L,36,Feb-16,Feb-16,40,A good way to spend the afternoon...,"Alight at the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station (5 - 10 minute walk)<br/>Free entrance for Singaporeans.  <br/>Chargeable for the special exhibitions that change periodically.<br/><br/>You need to get your tickets at the entrance, so just re-cap with the staff which are the free/chargeable exhibits.<br/><br/>Gorgeous historical building that's been renovated.  Interior looks spanking new, modern touch with lots of natural light.<br/><br/>My fav was the ""Voices of Singapore , 1975 - 1985"" exhibition.  Takes you back in time, with items on display that remain true to how things were back in the day, including a re-creation of a small drive-in theatre and old-school movies.  You'll smile and cringe all at once (in a good way of course!).  There's also a bicycle on display that once belonged to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his youth - a nice touch that adds depth and authenticity to the exhibition.<br/><br/>Not sure if the younger kids below 10 years old will enjoy visiting the museum as some of the themes / exhibits may be a tad adult for them but still worth walking around.  I bet some of the young ones will enjoy the ""Voices of Singapore"" exhibit like me :)<br/><br/>Lots of photo opp: natural light | dome-shaped ceiling at the entrance | spiral staircase on Level 2.<br/><br/>Small souvenir store on Level 2; items with a local flavour that Singaporeans and tourists alike will appreciate (think small pouches and coasters stitched with the Sarong Kebaya motif).  A tad pricey but makes for a nice souvenir.<br/><br/>I used this visit to explore the surrounding Stamford Road / Beach Road area and nearby museums (eg: Singapore Art Museum) - all within walking distance.  A good map is all you need.  Start early at 10am or 11am and keep walking!<br/><br/>Adeline Lee<br/>Visitor with another guest<br/>10 Feb 2016"

Kita U,778,Feb-16,Oct-15,40,Proud of Singpore Story,"This visit, plan to travel around museums. This place is first of me to go. With the building that used to be government house.it's take over years to renovate and redecorate on exhibition.<br/><br/>Museum is very excellent on telling their story through living life, tradition and history over 50 years of establishing. There is 10SGD for fee and tour guide in 2 hrs for round.<br/><br/>Should come, recommend"
,,,,,,
Lorraine O,85,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,Grand old building...loved this place,I found the National Museum very interesting and full of history.  Four floors to view and take everything in.  Learnt a lot.  Recommend this place for sure...well worth a visit.  I got a seniors discount which I was happy with!
,,,,,,
Plattypuss52,783,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,Absorbing Visit,"What an interesting and well thought out museum. The 3 hours we were there for just disappeared in the absorption of the culture , history and evolution of Singapore as we know it today. The story was told in a variety of ways and often interactive. Fascinating! Cafe ok too."
,,,,,,
Sandra B,134,Feb-16,Feb-16,50,Treasures of the World - British Museum Exhibit.,"Very well done exhibit.    I saw this exhibit on a tour - which was good and given it was only an hour, insufficient for viewing the entire exhibit.   It will require one and a half to two hours to get the scope of this exhibit - and it is well worth it if you are interested in an historical view of our planet. <br/>For young children, there are lots of activities they can do there. <br/><br/>See it before it leaves at the end of May"
,,,,,,
BarbaraP-BobS,27,Feb-16,Jan-16,50,Great overview of local history,"You should visit this your first time in Singapore to get an idea of the history of the area. It is a well-designed, easy to navigate museum with great signage. The grounds are also lovely."
,,,,,,
lair12,229,Feb-16,Dec-15,50,Enjoyable Afternoon,Very nice museum with interesting exhibits and good location.  Sits on the river.  We enjoyed a couple of hours in the museum (could have done more!) and then walked along the river back to our hotel.
,,,,,,
andrea2359,257,Jan-16,Jan-16,40,Thought-provoking afternoon at the museum,"Have been to the permanent galleries before, so I visited the current exhibitions on Treasures of the World as well as the very interesting World Press Photo exhibition (the latter with free admission). The latter was particularly memorable, what with the vivid images and stories via photojournalism all over the world. Truly a provocative and eye - opening exhibition that I was very glad to have gone for."

TeePodd,566,Jan-16,Jan-16,40,Charming Building houses interesting display,"I have been to nany museums in my travels and this one stands out for it's charming setting and exhibitions.My husband and I visited on the advice of a friend and we weren't disappointed. We choose the Singapore History Gallery and it was well presented with great original footage of events.my only criticism is that it is laid out in a slightly confusing manner, lots of nooks and crannies , so it is easy to lose track of one's direction.Well worth a visit and within Fortress Hill park area so many other things to see there as well."
,,,,,,
Patrick C.,129,Jan-16,Jan-16,50,Awesome! Don't miss this!,"One of the best museums I've ever seen! Amazingly well done, so realistic! Even the smell changes when you wounded through the different times!"

Bougnat_ie,"7,196",Jan-16,Nov-15,50,Educational and fun,A nice trip though the history of Singapore. I took the guided visit and I highly recommend it. You get lots of explanation and insight you wouldn't get otherwise.<br/><br/>The restaurant is quite good for lunch too.
,,,,,,
wayne j,98,Jan-16,Dec-15,50,The Youngest Museum In Asia?,"Not the biggest or has the oldest pieces inside but considering this wonderful island since independence is just 50 years young, this place should be on your visit list. Even the building iotself is just worth the walk around."

von s,121,Jan-16,Jan-16,30,A good place to see the history of Singapore,"There is so much to see here. There is no place to really sit when you are tired. the 800,00 year old tool was fascinating. The staff were  pretty helpful but unfortunately the gift shop was pretty had some pretty tacky items. Would have preferred to have quality items for sale."
,,,,,,
AlagnaGiac,208,Jan-16,Jan-16,40,Fantastic but noisy,Wonderful travelling exhibition from British Museum and the permanent history of Singapore exhibits...spoilt by two noisy European tour guides for cruise ship clients almost shouting their information to their attentive audience. How about some silence to allow the other clients to appreciate the exhibits and read without interruption?  Let them talk outside the exhibit and be quiet inside. Please !!
,,,,,,
KentM959,149,Jan-16,Jan-16,40,Great way to begin a visit to Singapore,This well organized and interesting museum presents an enjoyable story of Singapores brief history. The building is photogenic too. It is an excellent primer on the city that helps one appreciate the context of sites you see afterwards.

bamboo96,82,Jan-16,Jan-16,40,Worth a visit!,It will give you a nice prospective of the history of Singapore. I was there when they had a special exhibit from the British museum. It was well worth a visit!  Not a huge place. Allow 2-3 hours.

globelelle,22,Jan-16,Nov-15,50,Singapore trip,"The visit to this newly renovated museum was one of the highlites of the trip! I do recommend a guided tour, which is free. If you can, try to have lunch before the tour as the coffe shop in the museum is a little bit expensive. The renovation and the construcual work that went into it is very impressive. Will definitely be back next time when in town."

LKH47,88,Jan-16,Jan-16,40,National Museum,Lovely building with a modern annex. Only display things related to history of Singapore.  Excellent for everyone to learn how Singapore developed over the years.  Non-Singaporeans need to pay.  Next to Canning Hill which is excellent for a walk in a quiet oasis among the bustle of a city.

LisaandPete2013,31,Jan-16,Jan-16,40,"Great history in a beautiful building, well worth it.",We paid $25 for access to all the exhibits and enjoyed our visit. The history of Singapore was well done and you could also go on a guided tour if you wanted. Enjoyable.
,,,,,,
Redrosehorse,110,Jan-16,Jan-16,40,Wonderful,"While the website indicated we would have had to pay $60 for admission to the permanent exhibits, we ended up paying only $25 so don't let the prices deter you unnecessarily. We also found spending 2 hours on Level 2 was barely enough time and it was fabulous! My daughter found the scents piped in to complement the era so evocative and captivating that she just wanted to stay all day. The museum shop was also full of wonderful souvenirs."

Take a jacket the airconditioning is really high<br/><br/>Its architecture is really interesting with its junction of a colonial antique building and the modern cubical added aisle.

happycatlady123,26,Jan-16,Dec-15,30,Interesting museum on Singaporean history,The museum offered an interesting insight into the history and origins of Singapore and its peoples. It is located very close to MRT station and is just a short walk away from Raffles City. Recommended for a quiet afternoon with air-conditioning.

Blongtin,15,Jan-16,Jan-16,50,This is a beautiful building must see,The fact they preserved this building is wonderful but to walk through and enjoy historical reference and beautiful art is a treat!!
,,,,,,
VishwaMukhtyar,68,Jan-16,Feb-15,50,A great history lesson,"Yet again, Singapore, through all its modernity and presentation perfection, has managed to beautifully present its (little) history through the various sections in this museum. Unfortunately, much of it was under renovation when I went, but I did learn a good lot about Singapore and its place in SE Asia through a tour of the museum. Some cute books on Singlish and postcards are also available up in the store."

geeoff2015,30,Jan-16,Jan-16,50,Awesome !,"This building is a national treasure in my opinion . I was one of the guests invited to the opening of the Singapore Fringe Festival 2016 to see White Rabbit, Red Rabbit play and the space happily seated over 200 people . The rest of the museum looks incredible also !"
,,,,,,
UgglaOz,60,Jan-16,Dec-15,50,Fantastic Museum,"A wonderful place to spend half a day. The exhibition about the History of Singapore is especially eye-opening and excellently curated. Worth the price of the ticket alone. Also the section of Singapore's famous ladies through the ages. Not being from Asia we were not aware of all the details surrounding Lee Kuan Yew and what a truly incredible man he was and the amazing amount of good he did for Singapore. An absolutely fascinating story. The gift shop has a interesting mix of souvenirs, some of which were not seen elsewhere in Singapore. Beautiful building, well-maintained and all of the staff we encountered were well-mannered and very helpful."
,,,,,,
vivianyeong,107,Jan-16,Aug-15,50,Informative,"Would say it is the best museum in Singapore that can cater to most people, especially if they don't have strong preferences in art or peranakan culture, etc.<br/><br/>Does change their exhibits once in a while, and brings in featured exhibitions. Some of these can be rather boring/tailored to particular audiences. Would be better to bring in more exhibitions that will bring in more interested locals."
,,,,,,
ElenaIS,88,Jan-16,Jan-16,50,I didn't notice when 5 hours were gone,"Close to Bras Basah MRT station, located in the beautiful neighbourhood of some Management University, this museum is a collection of thematic galleries displaying artefacts and clear information. The audio guide is a must if you are interested to learn more. There is a nice restaurant with an open air area, and with tasty food, if you need  a break from the plenty of intellectual food."

hanaedgarjones,56,Jan-16,Jan-16,50,"Incredibly curated, moving exhibits",This is a world class museum. It's artefacts were presented so well and the perspective of history was very diplomatic. Lots of interesting facts and some cool hands on stuff too. We spent three hours wandering around.

Anneila F,136,Jan-16,Jan-16,40,A Must Visited!,"At the first sight, I've fallen in love with the architecture. Very incredible and so colonial. Inside the museum was about Singapore history since it was founded by Nila Utama, until the modern Singapore in 2015.<br/><br/>When I visited in 2 January 2016, there was an exhibition from British Museum. So I can see mummy and the other cultures from all around the world: Asia, America, Middle East, Oceania, ancient Greek and Rome, etc.<br/><br/>If you are a student, you can get discount up to 50% or even free entry."

Uhuru6948,181,Jan-16,Jan-16,50,Great Place to visit on a hot and/or rainy day,The history of Singapore display is well worth the visit. Senior citizens (over 60's) are entitled to a reduced price admission subject to documentary proof of age (e.g. driving licence).

TroyA184,107,Jan-16,Jan-16,40,Definitely worth seeing,"I found my trip to this museum very informative, not just because of what was in the museum itself but by standing in an entry line which took 60 minutes to get me in the door I learnt how patient Singaporeans can be - they were still issuing tickets written out by hand! Once in though The exhibits were great, especially on WW II and Lee Kwon Yoo."

Julie55055,37,Jan-16,Dec-15,50,"Exciting ""Top Secret"" exhibits","The new exhibits released from the archives are eye-opening. It shared so much of what the founding fathers held so dear, a vision of a flourishing Singapore. What really came through was their drive for this country, totally out of their passion to build a future for all Singaporeans. Truly heroes of Singapore!"

Anne O,30,Jan-16,Dec-15,50,Last day,"I had planned on visiting several museums this day but with 2 excellent exhibitions on, I found I spent over 5 hours here.  Beautiful and it has a fairly decent cheap eatery as well as a restaurant."

Inexology,"1,034",Jan-16,Sep-15,50,Singapore's History in One Building,"We spent more than two hours walking around inside the National Museum of Singapore and really impressed with the exhibitions that they have. <br/><br/>The museum allow visitors to learn about the history of Singapore from different aspects such as trades, the war and British colonisation, old tech tools and equipment, information about the Opium den in Singapore, old Ads campaigns and even a cool entertainment section of its own. We saw some of the funny paper ads including the tiger balm ads.<br/><br/>The entertainment section was a big archive of some movies that was made and released in Singapore (incl. those made by Shaw Brothers / SB) and they also had some of the movie props in the gallery!<br/><br/>We also checked out the fashion culture of Singapore where they displayed many beauty magazines as well as old clothing piece such as a dress with Campbell soup pattern.<br/><br/>I'd also recommend the museum if you're looking for a cool place to take a pre-wed photos in Singapore. The museum will charge a nominal amount of money to do so."

Adesitraveller,386,Jan-16,Dec-15,40,Great venue for a short visit,"My daughter's school holidays gave us a good reason to visit some of the museums in Singapore.<br/><br/>The National Museum offered free entry to Singaporeans but as we wanted to see the 'Treasures of the World' exhibit, there was a minimal charge for it.<br/><br/>The Museum itself is very well organized, cool and quiet. It's a perfect oasis for a respite from the heat.<br/><br/>Displays of life in Singapore in the old days is beautifully done.<br/><br/>The Treasures of the World was a fairly small exhibit but had some interesting pieces from the different regions of the world.<br/><br/>In all, a nice way to spend a couple of hours."

Robert B,19,Jan-16,Jan-16,50,Interesting history museum,"Do you wanna know more about the history? Go to this museum. It is a nice building, not to expensive. Al the rooms have a different look. With screens, sounds, touchscreen monitors can you learn about Singapore from 14th century till today. Time path is well explaind on storyboards to. Also paintings and attributes, land maps. It was an interesting visit."

JoshMainka,199,Jan-16,Jan-16,50,Informative and interactive,"Visited on January 1st and found that entry was free. This museaum is a great place to get a handle on the history of Singapore and it's transformation to the city state it is now. The displays document Singapore from it's early history, through British involvement, Japanese occupation, independence and it's now thriving economy. Well worth a few hours of any visitor to Singapore's time."

joskiNewJersey,81,Jan-16,Dec-15,30,Some bizarre modern exhibitions!,"Good place to cool off during the day. Best to go on Friday nights when it is free. Seems like local artists are trying very hard to impress &amp; make a social commentary. At times seems too forced. Very amateurish. Maybe, I am jaded as I have been to the truly great museums in NY, Boston, Chicago, Paris, Madrid, Vatican &amp; Florence."

Iza_T123,151,Jan-16,Dec-15,50,Worth spending the time,I really liked how well kept everything was. Exhibits were very presented in an interesting and engaging manner. It was enjoyable learning about each of the pieces. Information provided was also very helpful. The building itself is amazingly beautiful. You can take photos inside but without the flash. I accidentally had my flash on and was gently and politely reminded by a sweet young lady who was on duty to switch it off. Having a student card will enable you to get a discount on the entrance fee.

linusthomson,13,Dec-15,Dec-15,40,British saves the day,"Excluding 'treasures of the world', the museum is not the most outstanding one. It is informative about Singapore's history, but the variety of gallery is slightly disappointing. The exhibits from British museum are fascinating and  collections are nice. One drawback is that it makes the regular galleries look extremely ordinary."

Anna T,6,Dec-15,Dec-15,40,I reccommend a free guided tour,We luckily entered the museum just few minutes before a free guided tour started. The guide was a local volunteer who told us a lot about history of Singapore.

The duration is about 5 minutes walk from the MRT station. It is a place to understand about Singapore history. There is a Exhibition in basement 1, which is about Treasures of the World from The British Museum. And you can understand more about the culture and history."

Groundnuts,422,Dec-15,Dec-15,40,Beautiful and informative,"I'm not a Singapore museum fan. Not that I'm biased about local museum, but I felt our history is too short. I went because of the recent 'treasure of the world' exhibition where I visited. But when done and once I stepped into the Singapore history section, I was impressed with the design, lightings and layout. A lot of efforts, thoughts and planning has been put in to interest visitors. Very educational especially for kids. After a 2.5 hrs in Sgp section, it changed my perception of local museum being uninteresting."

Thapanat C,31,Dec-15,Dec-15,50,A must see place in Singapore,"I can say that it is the best place to visit in Singapore than Orchard Rd. and Universal Studio. This place tells the story of the nation from the stone to the late colonized period and also the story of the person who change to country, Mr.Lee. Every single second I spent in this museum is worth for the knowledge and the story of Singapore also. You had not to miss this place, if you were in Singapore."
,,,,,,
zakarikh,179,Dec-15,Dec-15,40,THE place to understand Singapore's history,"Not only is the National Museum the best place in Singapore to understand Singapore's history, but is in itself a great piece of architecture to marvel as well, especially after her restoration. Plenty of opportunities for photo ops abound and the gift shop sells many interesting and unique souvenirs and trinkets for locals and travellers alike."

Bep13,135,Dec-15,Dec-15,40,Quaint museum,"This museum is really important in understanding how Singapore was in its creation and path towards how it is today.<br/>It really sheds a light on how only 30-50 years ago, women were denied education.<br/>There were many exhibits about the culture and growth of Singapore.<br/>Also there was a limited time exhibition from The British Museum, it was absolutely amazing!!! <br/>This museum also has a pretty decent cafè, best milkshake i have ever had!"

Daniko8,"1,145",Dec-15,Apr-15,50,Lee Kwan Yew Memorial,"When I visited the National Museum in April 2015, it was actually closed except for the memorial for Lee Kwan Yew, who had passed away a week before.<br/><br/>Fortunately, it was free admission and I found it to be very informative. Being an outsider, I knew little of Singapore's history. The exhibit did very well in detailing Singapore's first prime minister and how he is responsible for the way the country is today.<br/><br/>I hope to return in the future and actually see the rest of the museum!"

Tartyone,455,Dec-15,Dec-15,30,brilliant building,"the building is at least half of the joy of this place, a classic building with a lovely seeming of new premises at the rear, the display is informative and well arranged, cafe, gift shop and a great rainy day activity"

Whitesaway,66,Dec-15,Dec-15,50,Not to be missed in Singapore,"This new attraction is a must.  It was so interesting, informative and so brilliantly presented that we would rate it as one of the top attractions in Singapore.  Top cultural experience."
,,,,,,
wilsongirl,467,Dec-15,Dec-15,20,Overpriced and overrated ,Paid an extortionate amount to see an exhibition of stuff I know well from the British Museum.<br/><br/>Sadly the other exhibits were more stuff I have seen on my world travels.  Nothing exciting and nothing much about Singapore.<br/><br/>The only really good thing is the actual building itself.

Playaman47,370,Dec-15,Nov-15,50,Delightful Gem of a Museum -- in English,"We stopped by this museum during a rain storm and were saddened to leave when we were finished.

thejetsettergirl,758,Dec-15,Oct-15,50,A must see during your trip.,"Coming here is the perfect way to learn about the history and culture of Singapore. I can honestly say that I learned a lot as there is a lot of information. The museum isn't too large so an hour or two should be fine, and admission is cheap. It's a perfect starting point for a day of sightseeing."

Classic in front, modern building behind, Singapore does civic buildings better than most. Current exhibition, 'Treasures of the World' from the British Museum is worth the visit. A compact collection, but check out the bust of Hadrian!"

Francis Xavier Tjoeng,631,Dec-15,Dec-15,50,Fantastic place to explore. ,"National museum of Singapore is one of the best Museum in Singapore.  Telling story about Singapore life from the beginning till now. For tourists,  you can pay a minimum fee. But for Singaporeans and PRs. . Entrance fee is free. But some exhibition needs to pay. But it is worth to explore.  Come and visit."

Christine4186,102,Dec-15,Oct-15,50,A highlight of our trip,"So informative- we ran out of time.  Some museums can be a little boring but not this one.  To start, the building is beautiful, so much so that wedding photos are frequently taken here and there was a bride and groom doing that whilst we were here.  The ground floor displays were excellent and provided such an insight into the lives of ordinary people following the invasion of the Japanese in WW2.  This was partly done through the voices of a couple , now in their 90's and their experiences.  They had even lent their wedding rings to the display.  As already stated, the museum also provided information concerning the history of Singapore up to the present day.  Loved it all.  We did have a break in the ground floor cafe, between 3pm - 6pm they had an offer of coffee and cake for $8 which was great value and   <br/>excellent.  (Outside that time, cake alone is $7).  The staff in the cafe were very pleasant and helpful."

pilarplmn,87,Dec-15,Nov-15,50,Wow!,Beautiful and informative displays of how life started in Singapore all the way to modern times.  Very interesting and exquisitely designed.  Right downtown.  The cafe on the bottom floor is kind of small and a bit expensive but very comfortable and good food.  Nice break in between the two main exhibits.  You can have lunch or just a drink.  Museum is only SD$10 but half price for 60+.  Great deal you can't miss!
,,,,,,
dolooper,104,Dec-15,Nov-15,30,All about SIngapore,"The museum has several galleries dedicated to different aspects of the history of the city-state of Singapore.  Women's lives and accomplishments are included, an unusual and appropriate approach.  The large and modern interior is broken up into 5 or 6 large galleries.  There is a fancy gourmet restaurant in the building and a separate little casual cafe.  The food at the cafe was delicious."

pragasam,"1,167",Nov-15,Nov-15,40,Most Enlightening &amp; Informative,"On the last day (Saturday 7th November 2015) of our Singapore Holiday, my wife and I visited the National Museum.  We arrived about an hour before our scheduled 1:00 p.m. guided tour and spent the time viewing the various galleries and exhibits in the older part of the museum. The Stamford Gallery on the ground floor had an exhibition entitled “We Built a Nation” to commemorate Singapore’s 50th anniversary of independence. On the next level (Level 2) the galleries portrayed “Life in Singapore in the Past 100 Years”. The exhibits were devoted to various aspects of life in Singapore such as Growing Up in Days Gone By, Voices of Singapore reflecting the new Singapore identity, Surviving the Japanese Occupation, and the Modern Era. There was also a gallery devoted to William Farquhar’s Collection of Natural History Drawings.<br/> <br/>We had finished viewing the Modern Era gallery, when we had to go downstairs to join our tour guide for the 1:00 p.m. guided tour.  Our guide was a pleasant, friendly Chinese gentleman who was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable.  Our group consisted of about a dozen people – all tourists from different parts of the world. After giving us the background to the Museum building and its architecture, our guide took us to the Singapore History Gallery which was in a modern wing at the back of the museum.  Our excellent guide gave us a most enlightening tour and an interesting narrative about the beginnings of the nation as a trading port in the 13th century, through to British colonisation in 1819, the Japanese Occupation from 1942 to 1945, post-war struggles, merger with Malaysia and finally independence in 1965 and present-day modernisation. The exhilarating and informative guided tour ended at a quarter past two, and we would have loved to spend a bit more time in the museum but had to dash back to our hotel to pack and leave for the airport to catch our flight back home to Australia."

Fi_and_Stu,50,Nov-15,Nov-15,40,Excellent place to learn about the history of Singapore,Really good museum which tells the history of Singapore.  It's a great way to learn a bit more about the country before getting on with exploring it.  Fort Canning park is also a really nice place to visit at the same time.
,,,,,,
Holly K,239,Nov-15,Nov-15,40,Join the tour. Great knowledge,"I got lost heading to the museum but got an opportunity to wander through fort canning. <br/><br/>The recommendation is to join a tour run by one of the volunteers. They are certainly very knowledgeable and will give you a brief run through in an hour. Then you have the remainder of the time to continue exploring the other exhibits , or if you're short on time move to the other museums close by that are connected by the free shuttle or walk!"
,,,,,,
Jay H,209,Nov-15,Nov-15,20,The latest revamp in Oct 2015 really didnt help Singapore's oldest Museum!,"Its latest revamp was a downright disappointment to me as a Singaporean!<br/><br/>It is now more cramped and messy.<br/>It stopped short of surprises when it gave me a decade ago when it re-opened......the mood in appreciating historical artefacts is not apparent due to the latest way of cramping all materials into limited space! <br/>Sadly, it loses all its charm into exploring Singapore's past. (Understanding Singapore's past with no depth is the best it can do now)"
,,,,,,
EarlGrey,700,Nov-15,Nov-15,40,Useful background for Singapore visit,This was the first visit we did on a short stopover in Singapore. It is within reasonable walking distance of Clarke Quay albeit uphill! It was a lovely air conditioned building that was part old and part new. It opened at 10.00 and only had a modest entrance fee. There was a good discount for seniors. The museum had lots of useful information about Singapore's history including the Second World War and it subsequent steps to independence.  It gives a great perspective for the rest of your visit.

I enjoyed  the Singapore history hall the most &amp; the museum has done a great job in bringing some of the facts to life.  I was less interested in some of the bespoke exhibits but there's enough here to keep you interested &amp; without having to spend hours trawling lots of rooms."

StephPec,56,Nov-15,Nov-15,40,Great for a really hot or rainy day,We loved it here. Learning about Singapore's role in World War II was very interesting (and the air conditioning was also a plus).

Kylie W,13,Nov-15,Nov-15,50,Modern beautiful Museum,I attended on an open day and was surprised it was free- normally $10 for adults. Perfect place to escape the heat for a few hours.

The exhibits are extremely well presented, not overwhelmed with text, and balances teaching and general information wonderfully."

Wayne R,47,Nov-15,Nov-15,50,A Must See!,Did not know the history of Singapore and this facility did a perfect job or organizing as much (or as little) information as you wished to experience.

12gotravel,52,Nov-15,Nov-15,50,Impressive,"Visted the Singapore History Gallery and the Life in Singapore Galleries,occupying level 1 &amp; 2 of this musuem. <br/><br/>The exhibits at the Singapore History Gallery is well organised.  Visitors get to learn about the history of Spore in a story telling manner as the exhibits are organised in a chronological timeline sequence. The exhibits are well curated. <br/><br/>The section I like the most is that of the Japanese occupation. Standing and looking at the exact table which the British signed the surrender agreement vis a vis the black and white video playing in the background of that historical event, one cannot help but feel goosebumps. <br/><br/>This museum does such a great job that you would feel teleported in a time machine to the history of Spore.  <br/><br/>Aim to spend half a day here. Great for bringing your kids to learn about spore's history and for any foreigners who would like a quick snapshot of what Spore went through before becoming what she is today. <br/><br/>There are toilets in the museum. Air con can be a bit cold, hence you may want to bring a thin cardigan."

There are lots of artefacts from various time. There are also many documents and mementos. The museum itself is very large. There are three storeys and in the upper part there is children activity rooms to keep the children happy for a while. There is also souvenir shop that sell uniques souvenirs such as books.

From dioramas to sounds clips, to artifacts, illustrations, movie clips, smells (frangipani and the old river)... use of technology is an example to all.  I especially enjoyed the comparative screens showing Singapore in the 60s and 70s!  Absolutely worth a visit - or several!"

The building is impressive and by the time we left we knew more than when we arrived but it was not, I regret to say, a tourist highpoint of our stay in Singapore."

However, as the exhibits explained, it is nearly 200 years since the founding of modern Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819. The building is very well preserved having been first opened in Queen Victoria's reign and has a multi storey modern addition to the rear.<br/>The exhibits are extremely well presented and give an excellent explanation of the development of Singapore over the past 200 years (and before)<br/>Definitely a place to visit for an hour or so."

Denise B,10,Oct-15,Oct-15,50,amazing!,"Going there was a kind of last minute plan. <br/>It is not difficult to reach with the public transport but you have to choose the right exit from the station. <br/>(I made the wrong choice so still now I can' t say what the best option is. Just ask to the station staff.<br/><br/>The museum is very interactive and everything is build up to give the impression to re-live the atmosphere of the ancient Singapura.<br/><br/>Very very very interesting!<br/>And cheap, only 10 dollars!"

curiouspoon,49,Oct-15,Oct-15,40,Great Docent Tour,"Get to the museum before 2 for an English speaking tour. We were lucky and had a great, informative tour guide. We did this on our 2nd day in Singapore and would recommend to do it before going all over the city.  The historical background helps a lot in viewing<br/>other sights. The tour lasted over an hour and only took you through the bottom floor of the Museum. The 2 Level was not as interesting without the docent...adequate information, but not done as well as Level 1 History Exhibit,"

PanamaElizabeth,64,Oct-15,Oct-15,50,"Beautiful Building, Elegant Restaurant, Free Exhibit: We Built A Nation","I went in to see the building interior and architecture and went thru their first free exhibit We Built A Nation, which I thought was excellent. It answered a lot of questions - like how a nation of so many different peoples, with different traditions, cultures and religions get along so well together - you can see part of their constitution and learn how Singapore became independent of the British, Japanese and Malaysia. It's a small exhibit and feels very personal. Worth it to take the time to go thru. There's a beautiful elegant old world looking restaurant in there as well. (not fast food - not kid oriented looking). I didn't go thru the rest of the museum - I'd gotten what I wanted."

Harriet C,101,Oct-15,Oct-15,40,It really gives an insight into Singapore,"A visit to this museum, helps you to understand not only the history of Singapore, but also the present. Perhaps where it falls down is in not giving enough information about the time before the British era.<br/>Nice exhibits, well worth a visit."

KGB777,"38,159",Oct-15,Oct-15,40,New permanent galleries are now open,"We have been here a few times before, but today was the first chance to see the recently re-opened permanent galleries and the focus on Singapore's history. There are some well thought out exhibits and plenty of interesting information on Singapore's evolution with quite a bit of interesting material from the period of Japanese occupation (1942-1945). Entry is free for citizens and PRs but $10 otherwise for adults. It's also a good way to escape the haze."

SFjoe,524,Oct-15,Oct-15,50,I felt I learned a lot of the history and founding Singapore,"This was a very educational experience about the early founding of Singapore as a major port, which colonial powers ran and abused the local population.  The unvarnished history of both British and Japanese occupation during the 19th &amp; 20th century and finally the road to independence.  I especially liked listening to the speech of the first prime minister Lee when he came to power.  a real visionary and determined individual."

red_gamer,40,Oct-15,Sep-15,50,Excellent history of Singapore,I've visited the National Museum twice now and have really enjoyed the immersive experience both times. Loved the audio recreations of each exhibit and the story it told about Singapore. The second time was with my daughter (then 8) and she didn't quite have the patience to journey through the entire museum. I spent around three hours here by myself. Loved it.

Akshay Agarwal,6,Oct-15,Aug-15,40,Go here to know more about Singapore past,I visited this place during my recent visit on Saturday's. There was no entrance fees at that time due to Singapore's 50th Independence Day celebrations. But to access 700 Years of Singapore History (a special exhibition) I paid $6.  Overall the place is worth watching.
,,,,,,
Susan C,50,Oct-15,Oct-15,40,a brief history,"This impressive colonial building has been extended with a lovely glass atrium joining the two parts. The new building houses the key exhibition on the ground floor. This is a history in images, objects and reconstructions and was very well done and interesting. There are four smaller galleries on the second floor depicting life in the colonial era and during the occupation by the Japanese.  We then had a very nice lunch in the Good For Thought cafe and there are some nice gifts in the shop.  <br/>We found Dhobi Ghaut station very confusing- exit A is closest to the Museum."

Myo M,"15,714",Oct-15,Dec-14,40,"Was here for ""Singapura 700 Years""","The museum was under renovation when I was here last December, but there was downstairs (on a basement level or something) the show called ""Singapura 700 Years"" which was a fairly good show (though it may have been a bit hastily prepared) displayed in five or six rooms starting from the ancient time when Malay kings ruled the island long before the British arrived through the British colonial period and the subsequent Japanese occupation period during WW2 to the post-war ""Road to Merdeka"" (transition to Independence) period, each distinct historical period in its own room.  One thing noteworthy I saw in the show is the bell donated by the daughter of American Revolutionary War hero Paul Revere to the British colonial government of Singapore in the early 1800's, and with no damage or crack whatsoever it looked like just what it must have looked like almost 200 years ago when it first arrived on the island!  Also liked the glass display cases with miniature figures inside depicting scenes from the colonial period, the WW2 occupation period and the independence movement period (kind of a voting scene).<br/><br/>The back part of the building seemed like an extension to the original building with the original back façade beautifully maintained, and it's really pretty spacious back there with a café on the ground level and a children's playroom or something on the highest level up the escalators.  And, going out of the museum through a side door at that back part (the door near the café) will take you to the outdoor escalator leading to Fort Canning Park right behind the museum.  Also, one more thing of interest outside the building is a bench on the left side (as facing the front of the museum) of the front grounds with five colorful sculptures on it which, I think, represent the figures of the five ancient Malay rulers of Singapore (their figures were actually also in the Singapura show mentioned above).<br/><br/>One way to get here by public transportation is taking the MRT to Bras Basah station (yellow line); once you're on Bras Basah Rd. after coming out of the station, turn right and walk along Bras Basah until you hit Bencoolen where you turn left, then just go straight on Bencoolen with the museum at the end of the street; it will only be about a ten-minute walk from when you get on Bras Basah Rd. after coming out of the MRT to when you get to the front door of the museum."

Lalitha5645,171,Oct-15,Oct-15,40,Perfect place to get a feel of Singapore's history,"The National Museum of Singapore is a perfect place to get a feel of Singapore's history. The ground floor shows the development of Singapore from its earliest days through the British times, then its occupation by Japan, and later its independent status to the modern city it is now. The first floor depicts life in Singapore over the years, and gives us a very vivid view of the life style of the people including the types of costumes worn, education, entertainment and the like. A visit here is very informative and definitely worth the time spent. They also have interesting exhibitions and festivals throughout the year."

JRa70,96,Oct-15,Oct-15,30,Nice information about SG history,"Good place to spend time for example during rain hours. Gives nice and good view to history of Singapore from different times.

bogdanvv,462,Oct-15,Oct-15,40,First thing to do if you want to understand local culture,"This is a place that can help you really understand the making of Singapore, through a well organized exhibition on the ground floor; it will take you around two hours to go through it and read and listen to the story, but it will offer also a good background for visiting after that the center for Contemporary Arts or the Art Museum; it is hosted into a nice building, with good facilities including a good restaurant, Food for Thought. If you spend some time in the city, this can really be a good place to start."

Pak Soon L,786,Oct-15,May-15,40,Brand New Experience,This is the first time we have visited this museum since our younger days. It has been completely and thoughtfully revamped. For Singaporeans the entrance is free for the general exhibits but you still need to pay for the special exhibits. We like the display of the archaeological finds of early life in Singapore. Worth a visit.
,,,,,,
Celizabeth125,37,Oct-15,Sep-15,40,Excellent museum,This  museum has recently been re-opened after renovation. There is an excellent overview of the history of Singapore. I was particularly impressed with the sensitive handling of the Japanese occupation during WWII. They could have dwelt on the atrocities but instead focused on how people coped during that period. There is also a very nice cafe in the atrium for a light lunch or snack to rest weary feet before moving on.

KiwiTravelers,75,Oct-15,Oct-15,50,"Impressive Museum,","I came here for a quick visit and was really impressed with the breadth of the information here.  If you want an overview of the history of Singapore this is the place to be. I learnt lots. The museum is modern and attractive, with a number of galleries, with the main gallery covering the history of Singapore. I really enjoyed reading the panels and interacting with the media.<br/><br/>My only regret was that I couldn't spend more time here. There are about 6 galleries and I only got through 3 very quickly.<br/><br/>Admission is about S$10 and to get your moneys worth you should spend at least half a day there - there's a lot to take it.<br/><br/>There is an older part of the museum but a new wing was built which took two years to complete - the joining of the 2 buildings is very tastefully done.<br/><br/>The location is really close to Raffles and is in walking distance from there. Also nearby is Fort Canning park. If you want o save your legs and almost killing yourself walking up there from the museum like i did nearly expiring from heat exhaustion, take the escalator which is situated next to the museum."

myfoodlady,145,Oct-15,Oct-15,40,A great place for family Outing (Educational and Fun),"The National Museum just completed the renovation and just reopen to public a month ago, an awesome place to visit as it let the visitors to have better understanding of Singapore history. We need to admit that the renovated National Museum have more interaction with the visitors as compared to the old Museum. Not only you able to see it, touch it, some of them, you even able to smell it, to let you have a real feel of the timeframe of the history. You may wish to request for a guided tour if you have difficult understanding these exhibits, which we personally feel this is really great services as the tour guide are very knowledgeable and jovial! FYI, all the Exhibition hall are air-condition, as such you able to enjoy these exhibits in a cool condition, great place to beat the hot afternoon sun and haze too. The Museum Building itself is well architected that good place for photo taking too. An exhibition worth mentioned is the one that showcase of our great leader- Mr Lee Kuan Yew, exhibited his living room, his study room and some of his items like the famous 'Red Box"". Another new attraction is a new ""Play Corner"" for the Children at level 3, which my children love it. <br/><br/>It totally free admission for the local or permanent resident  (all you need is to produce Singapore IC or student pass to proof your nationality ) and $10 charge for foreigner and $5 for Foregin senior citizen or student. <br/><br/>There is a cozy cafe at level 1 that sell some good coffee and snack, there is another restaurant called Flutes which I heard it is one of the top 100 restaurant in Asia in 2013, however we did not dine in as we just have our lunch before visiting the Museum. <br/><br/>We recommend to take the public transport - MRT to the nearest train station Ghoby Ghaut MRT, exit A then walk about 7-10 min. There also free Museum Shuttle services at Dhoby Ghuat MRT, City Hall MRT or Bras Basah MRT which about 5 min bus journey. <br/><br/>We spent about 3 hours to complete all the exhibitions hence we found it really a great place for family outing as it Educational p and fun tour for our family. Please give me a Helpful vote if my feedback will able to help you."

yatesy82,78,Oct-15,Oct-15,50,Fantastic museum,I cannot recommend this museum highly enough. <br/><br/>The beautiful building is worth the trip in itself. <br/><br/>The displays were interactive and very interesting- describing the development and evolution of Singapore to the place we see today. <br/><br/>We arrived here in the morning and would have spent at least three hours looking at the displays. Make time for this museum in your trip.

MarkLBoston,149,Oct-15,Oct-15,40,Young nation with a lot of history,"Singapore may only be celebrating its 50th birthday this year, but their history goes back many centuries and you'll learn about it all in this interesting museum. I spent about 3 hours and discovered much I didn't know about the pre-British years, the Japanese occupation, and the inspirational leadership of Lee Kuan Yew. One mild criticism: I wish some exhibits could involve the viewer more creatively."

SanDiegoPaula,51,Oct-15,Sep-15,50,A Particularly Well Designed Museum Experience,The building itself is a gem and the displays are all well done.  The are several eating areas in the museum and the restaurant with the white table cloths (I have forgotten the name) was excellent.

Admission is $10 for an adult, which is fairly affordable. Must do!"

DBunny90,32,Oct-15,Sep-15,50,Terrific!,"I highly recommend everyone, yes EVERYONE check out this museum. It has lovely architecture - lots of natural light, huge windows, massive columns and stairways.<br/><br/>When I visited, there were two temporary exhibits - a special SG50 exhibition for Singapore's 50th year, and a commemorative one for Founding Father Lee Kuan Yew. Highly interactive displays and very clear, informative signs.<br/><br/>The fixed exhibits were also very interesting. It was nice to experience the history of Singapore and see lots of childhood memorabilia.<br/><br/>Entry is free for the most part, but foreign tourists may have to pay a modest sum. <br/><br/>There are two restaurants - Flutes, and Food for Thought. <br/><br/>Easily accessible by public transport - they even have a free shuttle bus that loops three different museums - National Museum, Singapore Art Museum, and Singapore Pinacotheque de Paris."

Jennifer S,23,Sep-15,Sep-15,50,My Big 50 as well,I am an Ex-Singaporean on vacation from Adelaide in South Australia. I was last at this fine Museum in 1965. The museum had been refurbished for Singapore's 50th celebration. It was nothing like what it had been in the past. A definite winner as far as I am concerned. You can get a bite at the Food for Thought cafe situated on the museum grounds and with free Wifi it was very refreshing indeed.<br/>Their fabulous public transport the SMRT is the ideal mode of getting there. Everybody speaks and comprehend excellent English and getting lost is not an option. Entry is free but a modest sum for exhibitions.

Had been there on a weekday(during school holiday), our kid was the only kid on lvl 3 the kids' play room, so it's like a huge private function just for us!  On the weekend, quite busy.<br/><br/>We love the gift shop there, $23 for a mighty wallet - mighty thin, strong and eco friendly, great gift for men.  $13 for a unique bracelet, great for female friends."

Jade Cloud,524,Aug-15,Aug-15,10,The Museum's galleries are closed till 19th Sep 2015,"It's fair to say that the museum was 'closed' when we visited: the main exhibitions are still closed till 19th Septmber 2015. <br/><br/>I visited the museum a few years before, and decided to 'risk it' this time though I heard from a friend that the 'galleries' were closed. However I didn't expect it meant almost the whole museum was closed. <br/><br/>It was disappointing to find very minimal display at the museum, and that the museum was almost 'closed'. <br/><br/>The only open area to the public was a small section of the first floor, where Made in Singapore product exhibition was celebrated, and items made in Singapore (and Malaya) were on display. Text accompanied the exhibits so we got to appreciate the history of the items, and their links to the Singapore's history. Some of items might evoke your nostalgia. <br/><br/>The Made in Singapore display was like a mini warehouse. That was all we saw at the museum."

Janet C,48,Aug-15,Aug-15,40,Beautiful solid Building with amazing history,This is worth a visit especially if there is night festival on during the weekends. The building is visually attractive both exterior and interior. I was fortunate to visit the museum  during the night festival and in the day to browse through the history of Singapore. <br/>No entrance fee to enter building to view but special exhibitions will have an entry fee. It was a free event for the night festival.

Tabby S,108,Aug-15,Aug-15,40,Enter via the Back Entrance (valet parking area) to Beat the Q during the Night Festival,You can't miss the Anooki animation projection on the museum's facade (7 min between shows)! It is really funny and kids would love the cute characters jumping about on the wall! The Nighfest runs on the last 2 Fri and Sat of Aug so you can still head on over this weekend! http://nightfest.sg/. <br/>The crowds surged towards the museum entrance after the Anooki show so we walked towards Fort Canning (take the escalator near the illuminated 2 giant wire birds in the tree) and entered the museum via the back entrance (glass facade). <br/>I think the kids would enjoy the tennis ball swings art installation :) You can find out surprising things and brands that are made in SG too!

Lesley B,87,Aug-15,Sep-14,50,Amazing history,We were lucky to have plenty of free time and spent 5 hours in the museum and still want to revisit. We did not see everything fully but gave it our best shot. Exhibits were wonderful especially the section on the history of women in Singapore. We used the headsets which were easy to follow. There was an art exhibition and beautiful photographs. The gift shop had items not seen by us anywhere else. We stayed for coffee and cake which was delightful. <br/>Note: if you are a 'senior' they will give you discounted entry if you ask!

ZfyEd,"6,320",Aug-15,Aug-15,40,Interesting and Enriching Visiting trip!,"During the National Day Golden Jubilee long weekend, we decided to come by here for a visit to learn more about the history of this young nation. It has been ""x"" donkey years since our visit (at least 25 years).<br/><br/>As part of the SG50 celebrations, entry to the museum was free and so it attracted a big crowd turnout, not only tourists but also the locals. However, there were staff on duty and helped to divert the human traffic, so everything was orderly and fine.<br/><br/>And wow, the museum looked so much different from the past, it was nicer and more beautifully painted and decorated. Inside this similar Gothic style building, it looked brighter and more spacious.<br/><br/>And there it was, an exhibition of Singapore, introducing about its history since 13th century to the modern day of Singapore, spanning through about 700 years. There was also a section with displays of the things and equipment of the past (used in the earlier days of the nation), such as the TV set, Aircon, Gas stoves, familiar biscuit tins and other items. It was so nostalgic and brought back fond memories for us.<br/><br/>There was also an area allocated for children to do art and craft, drawing and visitors then could collect stickers, collar pins bearing the SG50 logo, post cards etc. These items were distributed free though visitors could make a donation to a box on the table.<br/><br/>A dinning area was there as well, cafeteria style serving finger food and local delights and also a place to stop for a rest and lay down for a cup of coffee after walking around the museum.<br/><br/>Near the entrance/exit is actually a gift shop, where visitors could grab some local-flavour souvenirs, ranging from keychains, postcards, t-shirts, artefacts, magnets to books etc (including memoirs of our founding father, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew).<br/><br/>Overall, our visit was pleasant and nice as we enjoyed so much in refreshing our knowledge about the nation building history, heritage and culture and did provide a good insight for us in some areas which we were not even aware or learn before. It was indeed more meaningful to visit this museum on National Day, and was heart-warming as we appreciated the pioneer generations for their hardwork and contribution in making this young nation to be 1st world and so successful!<br/><br/>The museum is located in the arts and culture district in the city center and from here, one can also visit other museums nearby as they are all located within 5-10 minutes of walk from here, such as the Peranakan Museum (Armenian Street), Singapore Philatelic Museum (Coleman Street), Civil Defence Heritage Gallery (Hill Street), among other museums and art galleries."

We also discovered that we actually learned a lot at school during Social Studies and History! :)<br/><br/>My daughter had a good time taking lots of photographs (flash off, of course). Some of the regular galleries were closed for revamp, which will give us a great reason to revisit later in the year.<br/><br/>Families with young children should head all the way to the top floor so that the children can have some time for independent free play.<br/><br/>Gift shops at museums always feature really unique and quirky items. As a Singaporean, it was really hard not to buy up the really cute Singaporean items. There was one whole section on 50% discount! I ended up with a watch that featured a spider for a second hand. The 'brand' of the watch was ""kan cheong""...get it? (Kan Cheong Spider!...LOL...the Singaporeans will get the joke!)"

Kath S,133,Aug-15,Aug-15,20,Good food!,"Visited this during the 50 th Singapore celebrations  and it was very busy.the exhibitions were quite informative but quite small.there were several activities for children ,hat making and wood printing and an activity area ,but we were disappointed that there was so little to learn about the history of Singapore.<br/>That said we had a delicious lunch in their restaurant !"

Peter0457,363,Aug-15,Aug-15,50,A Fascinating Glimpse,"We enjoyed a fascinating walk through 700 years of Singapore's history leading to the celebration of 50 years of nationhood on the weekend we were there. The history may be confronting to some nationalities, but shows the struggles for identity and the culmination in the multicultural Singapore of today."

Marco T,105,Aug-15,Aug-15,40,For those who want to understand Singapore's history,"The museum is currently composed of a free and a paid sections. The free part exhibits products manufactured in Singapore in the 60s only. The paid section brings you from the stone-age era of Singapore to the modern one while there are special partitions about British colonisation, Japanese invasion and post-colonial Singapore. By walking through the boards and pictures, you will have a full understanding of how Singapore transforms from a rudimentary trading port to a world-class city state. <br/><br/>If you are familiar with post-colonial Southeast Asian history, you may find that they mention nothing about how the Singaporean authorities rivalled against the communists in the 50s and 60s. I know it is a bit sensitive to mention but....anyway, it's very worth visiting and I definitely recommend including museum into your itinerary."

alyssassi,5,Aug-15,Aug-15,40,FOR HISTORY JUNKIES,"The outside profile awed me, the inside amused me! <br/><br/>If you want to learn the history of Singapore, you must pay this museum a visit. I enjoyed all to well the areas of this museum, too bad the others were on renovation while we were there.<br/><br/>For history lovers like me, this is a must. But it's so-so for normal people. My parents didn't enjoy it that much.<br/><br/>So overall, just good."
,,,,,,
JoyfulG,93,Jul-15,Jul-15,40,Some of it under renovation,we always try to visit when we are here. This time like some of the other museums bits were closed. Not due to be reopened until September. We paid for the gallery that was opened about the history of Singapore.another One was also open and was free. Lots of school groups when we visited in the morning. If you want to avoid this maybe going later would work. Look forward to visiting next time when it is all open.
,,,,,,
PeteGLondon,98,Jul-15,Jul-15,20,2 out of 3 galleries closed ........in July!,I'm not making it up! Both the History gallery and The Living Galleries were closed on the day of our visit. A museum disconnected from the notion that 'visitor experience' is important?<br/>The exhibition we did see was a rather 'state biased' account of Malaysia's history which was clumsily censored and ended in the 1980s.

chris c,161,Jul-15,Jul-15,40,worth visiting if you want to know about singapore,"my wife and i spent a few days in singapore and wanted to learn more about its history. A trip to the national museum was an excellent choice. Singapores history with the British, Chinees and Malasians was fascinating and its history from the 14C to today. well worth a couple of hours if you have time"

KeTeKaHa,158,Jul-15,Jan-15,30,"Nice exterior, but not a whole lot inside","Visited while in Singapore on business.  The exhibits that were available were nice, but many areas were closed, which was a bit disappointing.  I will probably give it another visit in the future to see if other halls are opened up for viewing."
,,,,,,
CaptCook,198,Jul-15,Jul-15,30,Beautiful exterior,"Singapore's pubic buildings all seem to have been given a new coat of paint for the island's 50th birthday celebrations. This is a fine old colonial building well worth viewing from the outside.<br/><br/>The collections are OK, but rather small in extent. It does take long to get around the whole thing."
,,,,,,
swingspan,58,Jul-15,Jul-15,40,Terrific presentation of Singapore's history,"This was my second visit to the National Museum of Singapore. Unfortunately, this time most of the museum was closed for renovation (loved seeing it all when it was open last time). However, even with the museum mostly closed, there is a special exhibit open which chronicles the history of Singapore from settlement through colonization through independence. Nice use of multimedia, and the level of detail is just right to give a visitor a nice sense of things without going into too much detail. Well worth a visit."

Ved Prakash,11,Jul-15,Jul-15,30,Place to know about entrepreneurs and products made in SG,The place can reached by boarding 147 bus from china town towards Stamford road. The place can also reached by mrt and get down a bras basah. It show cases the early products ..businessmen.. Starting of Singapore industries and others things. The museam building is a huge structure of architecture. The is a fee of 6$ for tourist and some concession for locals aswell.

Bentina T,168,Jul-15,Aug-14,40,A great introduction to Singapore.,Singapore has some of the best museums i've ever experienced and this one goes close to the top.  We went to this one first and it was a great introduction to the country.  The history is so interesting and you really feel like to know the country so much better.  It also seems to be honest about the good and bad of the country's history.
,,,,,,
Morgan S,6,Jul-15,Jul-15,40,Unexpectedly good,I don't normally go to museums but this provided a really detailed and interesting history of Singapore. There's 3 exhibitions but only 1 was open when I visited - this was still worth the $6 though. There's plenty of activities to keep kids engaged as well.
,,,,,,
Ben R,19,Jul-15,Jul-15,40,"Only one exhibition, but done very well.","They only have one exhibition currently, as they are refurbishing most of the museum to be finished by September. However, the exhibition they did have was very well done. It followed the history of Singapore through the last 700 years, with emphasis on it being ""found"", trade, Japanese occupation and then post independence politics. It took me about an hour and a half to walk through, reading all the boards and watching the short films, but it could probably be done in an hour if you rushed. Worth a visit to get an understanding of Singapore's history."

Andrew U,161,Jul-15,Jul-15,50,Beautiful building and superb exhibits,"We have visited the National Museum of Singapore twice, once in 2010 and most recently in July 2015.<br/><br/>The grounds and the building are magnificent and beautifully kept. The staff and pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and approachable. The exhibits are excellent and tell the story of Singapore's development beautifully.<br/><br/>Although most the museum exhibits are undergoing renovation at the moment the current display (a condensed version of the history of the island) is well worth seeing. At the current time there are many exhibits designed for children which are all interactive and which our son (5) really enjoyed.<br/><br/>There is great access for strollers and people with disabilities and the grounds and ground floor can be wandered around without paying the entirely reasonable entrance fee (S$6 if I remember correctly).<br/><br/>A must see on any itinerary."
,,,,,,
Gill M,171,Jul-15,Jul-15,30,Good exhibition but most of museum closed,"The building itself is very impressive and worth seeing for that alone. However, two levels of the museum are closed. I visited the Singapura 700 a Years exhibition, which was very good. It included a short film from 1938 and Japanese newsreel footage of the invasion. There is an entry fee of $6 and $3 for seniors for this exhibition."

kamakshi2015,"1,914",Jul-15,Feb-15,50,An impressive and beautiful landmark,"This is a must do thing being in Singapore . The iconic building reminds one of the big one era . The collections are impressive . The entrance nominal,fee and the easy access are added advantages ."

Rico P,515,Jul-15,Oct-14,40,Best Museum Ever Seen,"One of main attraction in singapore, ticket price are fair enough, place is located in central singapore and the museum have complete story of singapore from the beginning till now.. must visit here if you coming to singapore."
,,,,,,
Stankur,41,Jul-15,May-15,50,Excellent Singapore History Museum,"Very close to a metro exit , the Singapore History Museum was showing a special exhibition devoted to the recently deceased founding Prime Minister of Singapore, Lew Kuau.  The Museum also has an hands-on children's section and a large gallery devoted to the history of Singapore.  The restaurant had a very interesting upscale menu, but was so crowded, we had to move on.  The Singapore Art Museum is nearby"
,,,,,,
Trailertroll,117,Jul-15,Jul-15,30,Most of Museum closed :(  But 700 years of Singapore is great,"I am sure this place would be great, however there was only one exhibit open the rest were closed.  The one exhibit was 700 years of Singapore which was really informative."
,,,,,,
LinSerendipity45,17,Jul-15,May-15,50,700 years of the history of Singapore,"A thoroughly researched and in depth exhibition of the history of this island nation. For Americans, particularly Bostonians, look out for the Revere Bell which tells the history of how the daughter of Paul Revere, Maria who was the wife of the American consul, Joseph Balestier, donated the bell to Singapore in the 19th century. There is also a small exhibition depicting the charitable works of pioneer Chinese women and their European counterparts pre and post WW2 and also of the life and work of the first Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew who passed away recently."

WoooWho,"2,200",Jun-15,Jun-15,40,Learn about history &amp; an interesting museum with swinging lights!,This is the key museum for Singapore.<br/><br/>There are rotating exhibitions where you can learn more about the history of Singapore and civilizations across the world.<br/><br/>The museum has the historical main building and a modern annexe which has an interactive exhibition on the history of Singapore.<br/><br/>What's interesting about the museum is the row of swing chandeliers at the annexe block which sway from side to side. They are quite a sight!<br/><br/>There are also cafes and restaurants here where you can have a light bite or sit-down meal.

John S,780,Jun-15,Mar-15,50,Enjoyed the '700 years' exhibit,"Starting with some archaeological information the exhibit continues through the civilized history of the area, including both the British and Japanese influences."

Sue B,476,Jun-15,Jun-15,40,Interesting exhibits,"This museum is well worth a visit. The building is impressive, and entry was free. There are varied and interesting exhibits which are labelled in English as well. I recommend you spend some time here."
,,,,,,
Resnyc,64,Jun-15,Jun-15,20,Not much here,"The basic museum is free, and that's a good thing because it offers almost nothing to see.  However, a special exhibit ""700 Years of Singapore"" was definitely worthwhile and worth the nominal entrance fee.  Otherwise, calling this a ""National Museum"" is a bit of a stretch - on view was a love-piece memorial to the late ruler Lee Kuan Yew, and an insubstantial exposition on the historical role of women in Singaporean society.  In such a formidable, historical building, there should be a permanent, much more authoritative and substantial exhibit on Singaporean history.  Gift shop felt like a political-party-bookstore + a few nicknacks.  On the plus side, there is excellent air conditioning throughout the building, and the café has a nice menu and very friendly, attentive staff."

LeatherTraveller,325,Jun-15,Jun-15,30,Visit with neighbours and family,"Last visit was almost 3 years ago and after some recent milestone events in Singapore, we thought its timely to revisit. <br/><br/>We went for the LKY Memory and Singapura 700 events. <br/><br/>Most of us, or at least me, were taught with Singapore history from the days of Sang  Nila Utama. I was surprised to learn that our island were visited and occupied since 700 years back. <br/><br/>I hope we can dig up more artefacts and shed light on the early history of Singapore more.<br/><br/>The display of LKY in memory was a brief display of LKY during the formative years of our nation. Informative but lack dept. But sufficient for most I guess.<br/><br/>Good a revisit but probably won't return for another few years... I wonder what's necessary to make museum more attractive and visits more frequent?"
,,,,,,
KinaLinaBina,166,Jun-15,May-15,50,"Not a fan of museums, but loved this one!","Completely amazed at how much I enjoyed my trip to this museum. The current exhibition about the history of Singapore blew me away. It was ecstatically brilliant, very interesting, great flow, and best of all, it kept me interested throughout the full exhibit."
,,,,,,
kochiraja,57,Jun-15,Mar-15,50,Best place to understand Singapore's history,"This is the museum you should visit if you want to understand the history of Singapore.<br/>The museum building itself is very beautiful and of historical importance. Inside, there are various halls and exhibits that take you through the history of the land, which we know today as Singapore. Each exhibit has a description written in simple English,  which even a child can understand easily, displayed in a well illuminated area. There are a few interactive exhibits too. Everything inside the museum is neat and well organized.  <br/><br/>The museum is  located within walking distance from Orchard road, and you can be in and out within 2 hours. Its a recommended visit for anyone who is interested in the history of Singapore."

Dloo,126,Jun-15,Jun-15,50,"Catch ""Singapura: 700 years""","Although the National Museum is not as prestigious as a few other world renown museums, and is major renovation in preparation for SG50 celebrations, the temporary exhibitions are great windows to know Spore better. <br/><br/>In Memoriam: Lee Kuan Yew not only marks the end of LKY's celebratory life, it also tells a story of a nation.  This exhibit ends in Jun 2015. <br/><br/>Singapura: 700 years shares the complete journey of Spore to-date. Even as a citizen, I didn't know our history went back 700 years ago. It's most ideal if visitors can first take the free guided tours host by the friends of museum volunteers, followed by a second round of tour on your own. I also found some childhood memories of the cabinet TV, transmission radio and a rotary phone. Three of us, a mum and 9, 13 year old, enjoyed this tremendously. Check out for the timing of the free tours. This exhibit ends on Aug 10. <br/><br/>Certainly hope both of these could be included in the museum's permanent exhibits. <br/><br/>Bonus: includes a Shaw Brothers related exhibit and another one that celebrates women. <br/><br/>Extra bonus: tea special at the cafe was great too!"

Henry Kum,132,Jun-15,Apr-15,40,Great history of Singapore,"This place can see all types of history in Singapore. Before we became independence and Japanese Occupation. This island is already more then 700 years. Which make me understand more about my own country. <br/><br/>This museum is been many year maintain this shape and size. It got great view and eating area although most of the area are free but some need to be pay. It always crowd during weekends. Most of them are family members, students, tourism. <br/><br/>Best to go is weekdays and must not be school holiday because school holiday will crowd the area."

Popy,33,Jun-15,Jun-15,30,average,"Not so much to see exclude the exhibitions. you could enter the national museum for free, but to enjoy the exhibition, you have to pay the entrance fee."

sipivu,"2,125",Jun-15,May-15,40,Many rooms closed for renovation,"This is one of the 4 national museums in Singapore. Unfortunately, most of the rooms are currently closed for renovation.<br/><br/>The first objective is to describe Singapore's history. At the moment, there is an exhibition about the country's founder Lee Kwan Yew who passed away a few months ago. You can also see this exhibition in a digitize format in the museum's website."

AllanJane_11,356,Jun-15,May-15,40,Interesting exhibitions,"We found the History of Singapore exhibition to be both interesting and informative.  It is well set out and there are some very interesting photos from earlier times.<br/>The Lee Kuan Yue exhibition was also very interesting. Whilst I had known that he was the leader of Singapore, I had not realised how visionary he was.<br/>We had lunch at the cafe located between the old and new sections the food was quite nice.<br/>You can walk to the Fort Canning Park from the rear of the museum building -so you can spend several hours in this area."

lifewithkinni,28,Jun-15,Jul-14,40,Family day out @Singapore,We went on Bus to visit Singapore National Museum to explore the culture and art of ancient history. Liked the architecture of Museum and the display it was amazing. Must visit place for children.

wu1976,6,Jun-15,May-15,40,"Great building, good museum, few average exhibits, but enough to get your attention for couple of hours","Like I mentioned in the title, the building is fantastic. But exhibits are ok. Guess there is not much of history to be documented, but the curators have made the most of what they have. I felt there was something missing, but I can say with certainty that I was entertained for few hours."
,,,,,,
Rob,"2,973",May-15,May-15,40,Mixed,"Like so many museums this was a rather mixed bag.<br/><br/>It's free on for most of it. The big exhibtion was on 700 years of Singapore history. You have to pay $6, I think, in to see this. I enjoyed this especially the section on WW2 as I learned a good bit about the Japanese occupation. There was also a section on Lee Kuan Yew, the PM of Singapore for 25 years who has recently died, I learned a bit about him but I would have liked a bit more. It did make me want to get his autobiography so in that way it did the job.<br/><br/>The rest of it is a bit meh. A section on Singapore music from last 50 years just seemed a bit random. A few other exhibitions didn't really appeal to me either.<br/><br/>They are in process of making an exhibition on Singapore's 50th anniversary later this year. It will be worth visiting when that is on."
,,,,,,
Vicki E,397,May-15,May-15,30,Currently most exhibition halls closed,"The museum is housed in a beautifully restored historic building (old Raffles library and museum building built in 1887) with a modern annex attached at the rear. On my visit only two small free galleries were open (currently Leading Ladies and In Memoriam) and a fee paying gallery in the basement (history of Singapore). While a number of other galleries are due to reopen soon with new exhibitions, I was very disappointed that more was not open during my visit. I would strongly recommend checking their website before visiting. The museum is an easy five minute walk from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station (not well sign posted so have a map at the ready) and a number of public buses stop almost at the door. There is a cafe / restaurant on site (level 1) and a drink vending machine (reasonably priced) on level 2."

DrJAHenry,104,May-15,May-15,30,Nice museum,"A small museum with limited history to display, but well presented and interesting parts that you can enjoy for 1-2 hours"

Jordan D,20,May-15,May-15,40,Good value and good for a morning/arvo,"Although Singapore's history isn't too long, it is well presented here - showing the transition from a 3rd world country to a bustling 1st world city-state. Still good value but a lot is under construction for the 50th anniversary of Singapore."

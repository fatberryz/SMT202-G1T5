IRHS,186,Yesterday,February 2020,40,Interesting way to view all of Asia,"I spent a nice Sunday morning here. I enjoyed the artifacts - bowls, boxes and figurines. It's not all pictures and I enjoyed the way they presented them - not just by country but by what affected the entire region."
Sara Ng,10,2 Mar,March 2020,50,Place is very interesting with exhibitions,"Interesting place with many exhibitions, great for taking photos.  <br/>Many people come here to take wedding photos etc."
Travelswithboxers,67,Feb 2020,February 2020,40,Always worth a visit,"We've been to singapore many times and always drop in. Lovely museum, the exhibit of the beautifully preserved finds from a shipwreck was the highlight of this trip. We would recommend to friend's"
AyushBasu,194,Feb 2020,February 2020,50,(Min) 2 hours are recommended for this place!,"The Asian Civilisations Museum is meant to showcase the rich art and culture of not only Singapore, but also the SE Asian region. The building itself is lovely and has a strong presence, even though tranquil. The Khoo Teck Puat Gallery is an exhibit for the cargo recovered from the Tang Shipwreck, a sunken 9th century trading ship and gives an excellent overview of porcelain and other ceramics. Upstairs galleries house religious statues and idols of worship. This place is easily accessible from Raffles Place and City Hall MRT Stations. The permanent galleries are free for citizens and permanent residents. I would recommend a minimum of two hours here! A cafe and toilet facilities can be found here."
Jim_atl,"1,026",Feb 2020,February 2020,40,Interesting Museum,I spent a couple of hours exploring this museum.  You start with what was found in the ship wreck.  It was interesting to see how many items they packed on the ship and how they packed them to maximize the quantity.  The rest of the museum has interesting galleries with good explanations of the objects.  If you are interested in Asian history this is a good museum.
Malbena,89,Feb 2020,January 2020,30,Ceramics are not my thing,"I went to the Tang Shipwreck with high expectations, unfortunately I was disappointed. The exhibition consists almost entirely of pottery. There was no remnants of the boat itself. In other similar museum exhibits e.g. Mary Rose in Portsmouth, the highlights have been the everyday items of the crew. None of these items were recovered with this shipwreck, probably because the crew lived on the deck."
gursartaj,53,Feb 2020,November 2019,50,An amazing historical museum,"I have always been fascinated by such museums, and this did not disappoint at all. Tracking the history of all of Asia down centuries with artefacts, I felt I was part of the centuries long evolution. <br/>Must visit and budget 2-3 hours.<br/>The museum staff were very kind to tell me that I was visiting an hour before museum closing but i didnt have a choice."
normakk,291,Feb 2020,February 2020,50,Ink &amp; historical exhibition ,Excellent variety of ethnic historical items to showcase the diversity of Singapore.  <br/><br/>The Ink exhibition was a wonderful bonus with a beautiful display of a variety of traditional and contemporary paintings.<br/><br/>The friendly coffee shop offers welcome refreshments and there is also a restaurant and gift shop.
robynloswald,5,Jan 2020,January 2020,50,Fabulous specialised exhibitions,Whenever I am going to Singapore I always check to see if there are any new exhibitions at this museum. I have seen several very interesting and varied exhibitions over the last year. I am never disappointed when visiting here. The Asian anthropological exhibits and the Tang Shipwreck are also very interesting. I can spend hours here looking and the wide range of artefacts available. It is definitely worth visiting and is a very short walk from Raffles MRT Station. I have also had lunch here several times as well. This has also been a very enjoyable experience and a nice way to finish off seeing the exhibitions.
Kelsey P,41,Jan 2020,January 2020,50,Cool art/anthropology museum,"This is an interesting museum showcasing art and artifacts from all over Asia, including ceramics, furniture, and textiles. The second floor has rooms dedicated to religious items from Buddhism, Christianity and Islam. It is well organized with all the signage in English. It's the perfect size, and while we were there we got to do some fun arts and crafts. Recommended if you're looking for an interesting way to spend a morning."
ksthompson,23,Jan 2020,January 2020,50,You MUST see the Tang Shipwreck,"This museum has many wonderful things, but the cargo of the 1,000-year-old Tang Shipwreck found in 1998 exhibited on the main floor is truly amazing. It is one of the best things in all of Singapore."
nota1timetraveller,324,Jan 2020,November 2019,50,A fantastic Museum,This is an interesting museum. Not only do you find Buddhist or Hindi artifacts but everything related to Asia and South East Asia. The big exhibition with the findings of an old merchant ship off the coast of Indonesia is beautiful. <br/>This is a MUST go when in Singapore
David Coleman,21,Jan 2020,January 2020,30,Asian Civilisations Museum Jan 2020,Visited this Jan 2020. Small museum with some very good artefacts especially the horde of 9th Century ceramics found on a sunken ship in late 1990's. Has a pleasant cafe although on our visit service was rather slow
shinf2016,68,Jan 2020,January 2020,50,Worth Visiting ,"We came here on 2 January.  We were not sure if the museum was open or not.  But open!  First we entered the wrecked ship part.  It was really interesting to know the sea lane to link the east and west even hundreds of years ago.  At he same time we could get chances to know Asian civilization.  Though this may not be regarded as the spot for tourists, I believe worth visiting for tourists as well.  In addition we got kind guidance from a volunteer although she was off officially.  It was really kind of her."
Gillian L,161,Jan 2020,January 2020,50,Well laid out museum with good variety of exhibitions,We loved this museum because of our private interest in early pottery &amp; porcelain so we thought the Tang Shipwreck exhibition was superb.  The early Chinese and Japanese porcelain was also very fine.  The Hong Bowl &amp; the Famille Rose period Fish Bowl were stunning.
Lord_Dehf,211,Jan 2020,January 2020,30,I had higher expectations,"I think I had to high expectations on this museum. Don't get me wrong, it's a good museum, but it wasn't as amazing as I'd hoped. If you generally enjoy this type of museum, you should absolutely visit it. But perhaps lower your expectations a bit..."
qqtt,325,Dec 2019,May 2019,50,Excellent collections,"A very pleasant and sunny, bright museum, with BEAUTIFUL collections to get acquainted with the history of the asian civilisations. We spend three hours here and were really enchanted."
NYKGMGTGSG,154,Dec 2019,November 2019,50,Another amazing museum in Singapore!,"I've noticed that the museums in Singapore are housed in historical staid colonial style government buildings that provide utter surprise when you visit. The National Gallery, National Museum and the Asian Civilisations Museum, we visited on three afternoons and each one provided us with wonderful exposure to cultural and historical treasures. Though we had a scant 1.5 hours at the ACM, we spent time visiting the Shipwreck which was on display in NYC several years ago. Here we saw the full exhibit and I would easily go back to just spend more time in these galleries. The heart and the soul of the museum is the Works of Ink, a private collection that is among the best collections in the world, maybe outside of China."
JPNoosa,123,Dec 2019,November 2019,50,Well worth the visit,Lots to see without being overwhelmed. The galleries were well designed and displayed. We learnt a lot and were really impressed with the collections.
Jin G,55,Dec 2019,December 2019,50,Informative and interesting collection,An interesting and surprisingly large collection of artifacts. The temporary exhibition on Chinese ink painting and calligraphy showcases the works of great painters and calligraphers.
Stephen U,82,Dec 2019,December 2019,50,"The ""must see"" museum","This is what you could call a “proper” museum: full of fascinating objects, arranged to tell stories, intelligently displayed in context and properly captioned and designed to illuminate and educate rather than “entertain;” though, by illuminating and educating, it also entertains.  One could tag on to a free guided tour or just go where the flow takes one.  Subjects covered included the development of religions in the area and the history of Singapore and surrounding area in the time before Raffles turned up.<br/><br/>The artefacts from the Tang Dynasty shipwreck were impressive by their numbers and quality.  The shipwreck was not exactly in Singapore’s waters but showed the extent of the trade that came through the area back in the day.  The Scholars gallery, devoted to the Chinese ideal of “the Scholar” showed items of exquisite quality.  We visited at the time of the “Living with Ink” exhibition which displayed a superb collection of Chinese scripts and paintings.<br/><br/>We spent an afternoon there and should have found time for a return visit, but didn’t.  Next time."
Gail R,9,Dec 2019,December 2019,50,Time well spent here!,A fascinating and huge place. A whole day here would not be wasted.  The permanent collections and temporary exhibits are well presented and accompanied by explanatory maps and texts making the whole experience more meaningful.  Pictures are allowed.
sbp0713,138,Dec 2019,November 2019,50,One of the great Asian museums in the world,They a have an abnormally comprehensive display that is well lit and designed.  There are also great restaurant choices.
Maartje,7,Nov 2019,November 2019,50,Very interesting,"I walked past this place on my way to Marina Bay and got curious. I was not disappointed! The shipwreck exhibition is fascinating, as is the one of ink paintings. I also enjoyed the history of religion in Singapore and the trade in Singapore. There was a free guided tour with a museum volunteer, who was just so delightfully, endearingly enthusiastic about everything. Really great visit, would wholeheartedly recommend."
cricri97,141,Nov 2019,November 2019,50,Impressive,"I have seen plenty of museums over the world, but this is among the most interesting and best kept I have visited. The collection of pieces from the region in impressive. I particularly enjoyed the collection of pieces recovered in 1998 from the Tang shipwreck.<br/>Highly recommended."
AlabamaAnne,217,Nov 2019,November 2019,40,Many dishes,"We spent our last morning here, before departing Singapore. The building itself is gorgeous from the outside. The artifacts from the Tang ship were interesting, but so many dishes!"
blairkk25,"1,978",Nov 2019,October 2019,50,Fantastic Museum,"I visited the Asian Civilisations Museum in October 2019.  I paid a reduced ticket price of $4 SGD.  There is a lot to see in this museum.  Porcelain from the Tang Dynasty, artifacts from shipwrecks, paintings of China (Xiamen, Macau, Guangzhou, Shanghai Bund, Hong Kong), Asian furniture, statues, buddhas.  There are also sections on Islamic Art, Chinese Art, art from Indonesia and the Philippines, Malaysian Art, India and many others.  The museum is overwhelming if you want to study everything.  There is also a gift shop."
Hilary M,170,Nov 2019,October 2019,50,Wonderful,I have a great interest in Buddhism and this museum has a wonderful collection. Well worth a visit. There are also exhibits on other religions that are present in Singapore and information about how they were originally transmitted. It is a very cool and peaceful place to while away a couple of hours and there is a nice restaurant next door. I walked there along the river from my hotel.
Manoj S,3,Nov 2019,December 2018,50,visit on holiday,its very nice specially the garden outside. The museum has singapore history and very antique items. One must visit if he wants to know how singapore developed.
delaz,3,Nov 2019,November 2019,50,Very well managed museum,"Visited this place with 2 kids on stroller, it was pleasant as family group visit.<br/>For foreigners, need to pay SGD8 for 1 adult tickets. Museum was open on weekends too. Pretty good collection they have especially the Tang Shipwreck collection.<br/>Outside the museum is a small park and a river crossing. Kids can play around it too. Saw families on bikes too. Just a walking distance from this museum,around 5 minutes, you can get to Merlion Statue. convinient!"
Francisd,2,Nov 2019,June 2019,40,Museum will impress you.,Wonderful place to know the history of Asia and its Civilisations. I and my spouse really enjoyed it.  But did not have the time to go every bit of the place.  Will visit again to catch up. Enjoy everyone.
Rach979,"1,000",Nov 2019,October 2019,50,Interesting place ,"This museum was fascinating, especially the masks and weapons on the second floor, I really enjoyed reading the information provided alongside the interesting items.<br/>It’s cheap to enter and you could easily spend a couple of hours here, highly recommended!"
Stefan G,60,Oct 2019,October 2019,50,Fabulous collection,"Spent a few hours here and not nearly enough, the collection is great as are the stories around each item. Lovely museum!"
Yeo B,2,Oct 2019,October 2019,50,Historical building . rich content.,"walking in the history of this British colonial building , let you feel the grandeur of the time.<br/>exploring Asia’s artistic heritage."
Tim J,163,Oct 2019,October 2019,40,An Excellent Collection,"This collection quickly outlines some of the key contributing factors, from the last few hundred years, that created the foundations for the Asian countries in existence today. Spanning trade, culture and religion each room tackles a fresh subject. I would have liked to have seen more of an inclusion of Singaporean pieces, as there were very few."
bluepumpkinsoup,19,Oct 2019,October 2019,50,A favourite museum,Usually pay a visit on each trip since 2011.  Well set out.  Makes you want to visit more of SouthEast Asia when you see the artefacts. Excellent Cambodia Angkor Wat exhibition last year. Pity they removed the charming little video talks on the walls of rooms.  Tap to wake the speaker!
Steve S,"1,412",Oct 2019,February 2019,50,A beautiful way to see a cross section of spectacular Asian art,Easily accessible and reasonably priced with an extensive collection of a spectacular cross section of Asian artwork. A quiet space that is really well organized with lots of informative brochures. A fun place to wander and learn about centuries of amazing artwork.
Angela T,438,Oct 2019,September 2019,40,Guo Pei Exhibition with a former Town Convent Classmate ,"We had a lovely time visiting and admiring the displays of Guo Pei’s exquisitely designed dresses. Every creation of hers was truly a beautiful work of creativity, design and painstaking handiwork.  We were most awed and certainly impressed. The Asian Civilisations Museum is certainly the right venue for her displaying her fashion design works."
RandolphCarter1919,323,Oct 2019,October 2019,50,High quality museum and displays,"What an excellent museum, it went through the main Asian civilisations and had examples of their art, pottery and life. The curator must be proud of the way the displays were set up and how informative they were. The Tang shipwreck was a highlight as well as everything on the second story, even the booklets were high quality and informative, I had to donate extra as I pinched some to take home.  Best museum in Singapore."
Oddgumm,8,Oct 2019,October 2019,50,Museum of Wow!,"My 10 year old girl did not want to leave,  so we had lunch in the museum's exceptional cafe and did the floors again. As a San Franciscan,  I know Asian art. This eclectic collection is on stellar display. Lunch and artefacts from the depths of the sea through the sands of time! The best."
Ryu C,34,Oct 2019,September 2019,50,Heritage Indulgence,ACM is one of the cultural museums in Singapore where one can immerse steeply into the historical culture from both local and regional countries.
Arjun T,56,Oct 2019,July 2019,50,Must visit place!,There are not many museums that focus on Asian Civilizations so this makes it a must visit place. There is a lot to see and do so expect to spend atleast 1 to 2 hours and take a free docent tour. After that visit the pretty museum Cafe where you can also sit outdoor on the deck overlooking the Singapore River and high-rises of the downtown district
Jeffry b,"5,199",Oct 2019,July 2019,50,How Asian civilisation influences Singapore,"If you only have a short time in Singapore, this museum is well worth seeing, it's one of the best museums in Asia. It catalogues the evolution of Asian civilsation and religions. The museum is in the imposing Empress Place building, built in 1865 by Indian convicts. It was once the headquaters of the British colonial administation. It's a tad surprising that Singapore lives so well with its heritage of diverse Asian cultures, this museum helps explains why.. I would put this on my ""don't miss"" list."
Kevin Saint Ghislain,88,Oct 2019,September 2019,40,Good place to shelter,"It is a really good museum with quite some interesting pieces. Not high on the list unless history buff, but certainly not a waste of time."
Denis O,7,Sep 2019,September 2019,50,Needed to spend more time,This Museum provided me with insight as to how the four major religions evolved in Singapore - I very much want to back there.
Chrisinkingwood2,"5,053",Sep 2019,September 2019,50,A really first class museum with excellent displays,"We really enjoyed this museum, not only because it's nice and cool inside with the AC running full blast but you learn so much about the history and culture, especially all of the religions that shaped this region.  <br/><br/>Only bad thing was the day we went was the last day for a big exhibit of gowns and dresses by a famous Chinese fashion designer. We really were not as interested in seeing that exhibit but it made for a very long line of people buying tickets. Took almost an  hour to work up to pay for ours. <br/><br/>We felt the displays of art and statues inside and the lighting were really the best we have seen in a long time. The descriptions were very well written."
Noel F,38,Sep 2019,August 2019,50,Simply exceptional,The Asian Civilisations Museum is a must for all visitors. The permanent displays and special exhibitions are always excellent. This is one of the world's premier museums. I especially recommend the Tang Shipwreck and the ceramics collection. I visit the museum every time I go to Singapore. (and the restaurant is excellent)
Rahul2604,"27,780",Sep 2019,September 2019,40,Interesting ,"Good collection of artifacts from all over asia,good for understanding history of Singapore and also about different religions which originated from Asia,worth for the ticket,have at least 3 hr,also close to many attractions."
Cristina T,170,Sep 2019,March 2019,40,this review is about the cafe at the asian civilisations Museum,Highly recommend the cafe for a meal. The fancy restaurant was closed and we were caught in a storm there so we decided to try the cafe. We were a little skeptical but decided to try the Hainanese chicken and a couple of other dishes including a salad. it was excellent.
Susan C,64,Sep 2019,September 2019,50,Worth the price ,My surprise at finding that the entrance fee was $8 (not $4) was quickly covered with other emotions. A great exhibition of many of the civilisations close to Singapore. Loved the art - And the balanced presentation of various religions &amp; their art.
Ann W,7,Sep 2019,September 2019,50,So much,Such an interesting place - loved the ‘Trade’ section. Helped explain Singapore’s historical and geographical importance.<br/>Beautiful artefacts from so many religions on display.
Globetrotter10079,377,Sep 2019,September 2019,40,Interesting place to visit,"I saw some real gold coins, gold Kriss sword, and learned about many Asian cultures there. There is a free tour that I had of one of the galleries."
Joey,33,Sep 2019,September 2019,40,Nice Museum ,"Was here last week visiting the Guo Pei exhibit, very nice and enjoyed seeing some of the other Asian exhibits. The gift shop though seems to  be need of merchandise."
CanberraTripper,55,Sep 2019,September 2019,40,Something for everyone,"The museum is conveniently located in a beautiful building. The range of displays means that everyone is catered for. The permanent displays include a fascinating exhibit of artefacts retrieved from a very old shipwreck, leading to further displays of the many items traded between Asian countries and the rest of the world. There is also a comprehensive exhibition about the various Asian religions. At the time of my visit the temporary exhibitions included a kid-focused interactive display of a cardboard world and a group of amazing fashion items designed and produced by a young Chinese designer."
Loriju,104,Sep 2019,September 2019,50,Most Outstanding Experience in Singapore ,"Brandon Chia’s two hour guided tour of the Asian Civilization Museum brought the history of the Chinese experience in Singapore to life. The museum is a treasure trove with many fascinating artifacts, which Brandon’s exceptional tour connected in a meaningful way.<br/>Spend the extra money for the guided tour as opposed to the audio and you won’t be sorry. Tour included tickets for tea and an egg custard pastry at a nearby bakery."
T6993KXdavidm,695,Sep 2019,September 2019,50,Wonderful,A real eye-opener as to the many different cultures and their offerings to civilisations over the years<br/>Worth a visit
David B,31,Sep 2019,September 2019,40,Very interesting museum,"The exhibits are well laid out and sympathetically displayed.<br/>Clearly defined galleries help in understanding the history of Asia.<br/>Was lucky enough to visit when the Guo Pei exhibition was on. Not a ""fashionista"" myself, but found the exhibits astounding in their craftsmanship.<br/>All on all a very pleasant way to pass a couple of hours in Singapore. Highly recommended"
Freedom12795220676,4,Sep 2019,August 2019,30,Nice historical building......,"Love the building, has a lot of character and was a great experience visiting the place!  For sure a worth experience for travellers"
Christine C,12,Aug 2019,August 2019,30,Good if this is your interest area,It was okay but I wasn't too impressed. I thought I'll have a look around but apart from the section about the ship wreck I wasn't too engaged in the exhibitions. So unless you are interested in this topic you may like to consider visiting other places instead.
Elisabeth A,20,Aug 2019,July 2019,50,Asian history: past and present,"This museum is not the largest, but it is a very manageable size.  We saw an exhibit about trade throughout Asia that was fantastic and really helped us learn about the geography and history of this region.  We were also lucky enough to stumble upon an exhibit by fashion designer Guo Pei that was mind blowing.  There are also many rooms filled with Asian artifacts. Most rooms were dark and cool, allowing for peaceful meandering."
Chickerdees,403,Aug 2019,August 2019,40,VERY INTERESTING ,"This is a large museum space featuring the fashion of Guo Pei and other varied minor exhibitions. The spaces do not seem crowded, the visitor stream flows and it’s provides a wonderful inside into many aspects of Asian culture."
Jan W,2,Aug 2019,July 2019,50,Museum Highlights,Take the free tour it is very informative.<br/>The Tang Shipwreck is worth seeing.<br/>The Guo Pei Exhibition was amazing.<br/>To much to see in a few hours would need a couple of visists.
Shanna K,57,Aug 2019,August 2019,50,Amazing ,Beautiful museum. So much to see in each section. Learning about all the different religious arts. The Asian fashion was jaw dropping. We spent a lot of time here and enjoyed every moment.
Farouq T,83,Aug 2019,July 2019,50,Lots of interesting displays covering key faiths in the Asia region,"This is a really nice place to visit if you are in the area. There is a lot to cover with displays covering Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Islam in the region."
Simply A. Yeo,"12,479",Jul 2019,July 2019,50,Nice architecture and historical,A very old and historical museum with a very appealing architecture. Was sitting outside and admiring it. Good to stop and smell the flowers as office is nearby.
Lukas S,217,Jul 2019,June 2019,50,Certainly worth visitng,It's a wonderful place to learn about the Asian cultures over the centuries. I really ennjoyed the exibishions. Although it is located in the heart of the city it is not overrun with the tourist.
A N,53,Jul 2019,July 2019,50,Fantastic museum experience,This museum features wonderful history of the trade of East and Southeast Asia. It has a terrific collection of ceramics and uses that as an anchor to retell the story of Asia. <br/><br/>The current special exhibition of Guo Pei is amazing as well. The museum really emphasizes arts and crafts and their place in history. <br/><br/>I think it's very well curated. I was able to take a tour and it was well done as well. The staff are helpful and professional. It's a lovely building. It's not too large or too small. It's one of my favourite museum experiences ever to be honest. Great job!
Jane800,166,Jul 2019,July 2019,50,Fascinating museum,"Greatly surprised by this museum. Beautiful exhibits, well displayed and hardly anyone there. Ceramics from shipwreck were amazing."
FyingKiwi,702,Jul 2019,July 2019,40,Ceramic Delight,"This museum features excellent displays of Chinese ceramics over a thousand years old that had been recovered from a discovered shipwreck. Condition of the pottery and other artifacts is absolutely stunning and beautifully displayed for viewing. Museum also features many very interesting artifacts from various Asian civilizations, providing visitors with a visual and written feast of historical information."
Kaymtravel7,700,Jul 2019,May 2019,40,Fascinating history and artifacts,"This was a very well executed museum with lots of history about Southeast Asia. My favorite part was the exhibit about the shipwreck with interesting items and stories depicted. Upstairs, the sections on religions in Southeast Asia were also very informative. After a while the museum does start to seem the same, but it was a beautiful building and a very reasonable entry fee. The café inside was also delicious, and the air-conditioning is great. A lot of people seem to think this is one of the best museums in Singapore."
MKB1701,690,Jul 2019,April 2019,40,Well done smaller museum,"I split off from the family to take in the Raffles exhibition and it was both informative and enjoyable. The museum proper has several interesting exhibits; the Tang dynasty pottery was an effective way to illustrate the centuries-old trading routes that Singapore has been a part of. Rest of the museum was solid if not spectacular - if they didn't have the very strong Raffles materials, I would have probably had a different opinion."
SilverYorkie70,868,Jul 2019,July 2019,30,One in a series of museums,"To appreciate the culture of the early civilisation connecting Singapore, one has to visit several other museums to get a better picture. The finding of several dozens of porcelain bowls in a sunk sea going vessel occupied quite a large area of the museum. The arrival of several religions to Singapore was well documented. Some of the exhibits appeared to have been shared with other museums locally.  As a result, items displayed can be sketchy.  Whether it's for commercial reasons or otherwise, to get a better picture of the origins of Singapore in terms of culture, diversity, trade and the pioneering inhabitants, a large museum encompassing all the exhibits would have been more rewarding for the visitors. Yes, all locals have free admission, probably subsidized by the hundreds of thousands of paying overseas visitors, this system does not appear to take place in other countries."
Richard K,"1,128",Jul 2019,July 2019,50,Fantastic ,A really great way to better understand Singapore and the region.  As great now as it has ever been.  Great place
PapitoK,41,Jul 2019,May 2019,20,Not my cup of tea!,"I found the museum only mildly interesting to be honest.  A beautiful building, a great cafe and a lovely cool down in the AC are the best things I can say about it."
justicewillprevail,74,Jul 2019,August 2018,50,"One of the nicest, best located museums in Singapore","Drop by if you're in the Raffles Place area, especially on a hot day for the air-conditioned comfort. It's an interesting place, but I was on a free tour so I cannot comment on the costs for tourists."
keith_c,4,Jul 2019,November 2018,40,came to understand more of singapore history,great place for visitors outside singapore to know more of us as multi-cultural country.<br/>as well as for locals to understand better each other races.
Pascale C,1,Jun 2019,June 2019,50,Fabulous temporary exhibit of Designer Guo Pei dresses,Very impressive display of delicate workmanship and nicely intertwined with antiques from the ACM collection !
EJBSHJ,109,Jun 2019,June 2019,40,Wonderful exhibitions,"We especially loved the exhibition of the recoveries from the Tang shipwreck which occurred around 800 (if I'm remembering correctly). Beautifully displayed. The entire museum is beautifully done and well worth a visit,"
CHews,206,Jun 2019,June 2019,50,Simply excellent,"This is a must see museum. Huge exhibition of different Asian cultures and religions that is both fascinating and educational. Do take time out to visit - it is well worth it.<br/>Congratulations to the curator for a well set out,designed and most importantly, well lit exhibitions I have seen for a while."
Adrian Y,475,Jun 2019,May 2019,40,Excellent collection of artifacts with good explanation,The Asian Civilisations Museum has an excellent collection of artifacts with good explanation. The goods from the Tang shipwreck are spectacular. <br/>Entry is SGD 8 for foreign visitors.
Roy F,188,Jun 2019,October 2018,40,Nice place to chill and learn about history,This place offered a venue to chill from the hot weather while bringing you into the time long long time ago through its exhibits.
L.C. Gan,5,Jun 2019,July 2018,50,rich and excellent display of Asian Civilization artifacts ever been anywhere in Asia.,Seen is better than read. We can see and feel the displays telling us the years of culture plus civilization in Asian past. Worth all the time spent in the museum for understanding or better than reading the Asian civilization. It will be an extra incentive if your just in time to see more of your history as there are always the museum to show as many as possible of the Asian artifacts.
Christine B.,115,Jun 2019,April 2019,40,Very nice museum,"I learned a lot during my visit. <br/>What I liked the most: 1. The lighting is very well done; at the same time dim enough to be comfortable but focused in the correct locations so that the pieces are put forward. 2, The building is pretty both on the inside and the outside and the rooms are very spacious. 3, There is ample space between pieces and very clear written descriptions. 4, The museum has benches to sit on in most rooms, which is very appreciated during a long visit.<br/>The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because there is no clear traveling direction. I understand that this may be difficult to plan in such a building but we ended up going into dead-ends and retracing or steps multiple times. But that is a very minor negative. I highly recommend this museum!"
Nunngo,"1,596",May 2019,November 2018,50,So lucky to chance by this place,"This museum was not in my plan for the day but how lucky that I ventured in.  The exhibits were fabulous, really interesting and unique.  Absolutely loved it, spent over 2 hours there and could probably have done more but ran out of time.  Museum tours are free and very informative.  Well worth the visit."
Chianvern,4,May 2019,April 2019,50,Impressive Collections and Details,Collections cover all major religions/cultures in Asia with interesting stories about how the religions were spread across the countries (e.g Christian in China). Great place for kids and adults! My adult friend even spent more than 3 hours during the visit!
Bernd E,30,May 2019,March 2019,50,Very interesting ,This museum should be a must-have for a visit in Singapore.<br/>It has a quite good mixture of artefacs and information and helps you to understand the ideas behind the singaporeans politic.<br/>And it shows the connections between the asean countries during the centuries.<br/>A visit to that museum should be a must on a stay in Singapore.
Elisabeth E,275,May 2019,May 2019,50,"Compact, well endowed and enjoyable",This was a lovely morning activity for the family. The museum houses a large collection of pottery but also ornate pieces from the many different civilizations that occupy this region. Make sure you visit all the rooms. Each has pieces more interesting than the other.
Lyn Lim,190,May 2019,May 2019,40,Lynlim,Great artefacts that were displayed in the museum of Tangs Shipwreck!  Many &amp; most of the unique china pottery &amp; kitchen wares are still stunningly  beautiful and intact with its originality!   I am so amaze on the fish bowl 😃.  Entry is free just remember to bring along your passport for tourists &amp; Residents bring your identity card to register.  Most of the cafes are great for relaxing your tired feet

MyrrhAdventures,56,May 2019,October 2018,50,Great museum,Take the time to visit the Asian Civilisations Museum.  It is very large and well done with a variety of exhibits.
Juniper Keeks,32,May 2019,April 2019,40,Providing Context,"Open until 9pm on a Friday night, I enjoyed the evening wandering through here. Loved learning about the trade routes and influences, and understanding Singapore pre-European involvement."
Anonym_Traveller,45,May 2019,May 2019,50,Great museum - a must do in Singapore !,"The Asian Civilisations Museum may be a bit tiny, but it's a place definitely worth to check out ! It is well-guided and the explanations are very clear and interesting, and there's a free paper gallery guide which sums up it all. My personal favourite was the ""Tang Wreckship"" part, first floor. Worth noting that in the ""Arabic Art"" section, there's a free children book about southeast asia.<br/>(Free for Singaporian, 4S$ Foreign Student, Handiccaped, Senior 8 s$ full price)"
CraigH3,199,Apr 2019,June 2018,50,Worth a look.,Really great presentation of the Angar Wat history and artifacts.  Went with 17yo son who was not as impressed but very enjoyable if this is your type of attraction.  Wasn’t too dear.
ridgerunner077,64,Apr 2019,April 2019,40,Great place to see and learn about Singapore's beginnings.,This museum is in a wonderful older building that has been updated inside. They were having a special display when I was here on Raffles one of the men who help develop Singapore. I spent 3 hours here and could have easily spent more.
Dheer Sanghi,7,Apr 2019,March 2019,50,Asian Civilisation Museum - The Raffles Exhibit and the Tang Shipwreck,"The Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM), located near Clarke Quay, is dedicated to exploring the rich artistic heritage of Asia and gives great insight into life before the 20th century. It highlights Singapore’s history as a port city and provides informative exhibits that will change your perspective of people, places, and processes. I did 2 different tours of the ACM. The first one was about Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and his time in Java, and the second was about the Tang Shipwreck.<br/><br/>Sir Stamford Raffles is known as the founder of Singapore. There are schools, roads, and various monuments named after him. But who was he really? According to our volunteer docent, “Raffles is a man of many monikers; scholar, scoundrel, administrator, plagiarizer, reformer, statesman.” This tour gives a peek into the life of Raffles from different perspectives. It details his thoughts, feelings, and mindset through his collection of art. Most Singaporeans remember Raffles due to his brief 10-month stay in Singapore but in reality, he rose to prominence during his residence is Java, Indonesia. The story of this man has been interpreted and misinterpreted hundreds of times. This tour also described the great empires of Java and the intricate relationship between Britain and its colonies. Additionally, displayed at the museum are several collections of art, trinkets, masks, puppets, gamelan ensemble, and more by Raffles. As a Singaporean Resident, this tour gave me a new understanding of the man who is so cherished by locals and foreigners alike. <br/><br/>In 1998, a shipwreck discovered near Sumatra islands, south of Singapore, was found to contain a remarkable cargo of ceramics, gold and silver objects. The story started about 1100 years ago, during the time of the Tang dynasty in China. Trade was flourishing between China, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The objects recovered show us the strong demand for rare objects, and the artistic skills possessed by craftsmen back then. This gallery, with its stunning artifacts and displays, tells a story of lost civilizations.<br/><br/>There were also some interesting quotes by the guides at the museum:<br/>“Raffles is a man of many monikers; scholar, scoundrel, administrator, plagiarizer, reformer, statesman.”<br/><br/>“The Tang Shipwreck helps us understand arguably the most important period of human history, the time of the trade.”"
djmcd33,13,Apr 2019,April 2019,50,Best Museum in town,"If you have time for only one museum, make it this one. The story of SE Asia is told through the incredible collection of artifacts on display, including the spectacular Tang shipwreck ceramics from the C8&amp;9th. They do great tours in different languages, the docents are very well informed. If you live in Singapore, join the Friends of the Museums and come to their regular Monday morning lecture series or Friday with Friends lectures held on friday evenings. They have speakers who are passionate about their subjects."
CanuckWineGuy,122,Apr 2019,April 2019,50,A worthy visit for travelers from N.A.,"Being from Canada I wanted to get a better/clearer idea of different Asian cultures through art, artifacts and religious items. The well laid out 3 floors of this museum did exactly that. My wife and I were there for better part of 4 hours (can be done much quicker if you choose), what we saw was breathtaking and helped me understand regions/cultures/religions and their impact."
Cindy M,275,Apr 2019,April 2019,50,Beautiful displays! ,"This beautiful and well laid out museum is a must see if you’re in the area. The displays are well lit, with good descriptions in English. The museum is uncluttered yet full of fabulous antiquities from all around Asia that are beautifully displayed. The Tang shipwreck display was one of my favorite areas with thousands of porcelain bowls pulled from the bottom of the sea, displayed as ocean waves. Lovely. We spent about an hour and a half there but one could easily spend three hours and never be bored. Nice museum shop."
louisej856,464,Apr 2019,April 2019,30,Interesting...but could be developed more,"I don’t think I realised that the $20 entry fee only applied to the special exhibition on Raffles in South East Asia, but I agree with other reviewers’ comments that the price is steep for what is essentially a small collection of drawings, masks and other objects.  <br/><br/>There are a lot of objects on display in the other areas of the museum, including an interesting display of religious artefacts representing a variety of faiths.  But what was lacking for me was an overall narrative of how people lived their lives in Asia at different times and in different places."
kathy b,"3,331",Apr 2019,March 2019,40,An impressive visit,First time visit since renovations.  All very well displayed.  Check out the guided tour and special interest talks.
lizcraven,241,Apr 2019,February 2019,50,Chose this for our last day and it was excellent!,We had a terrific guide and learned so many interesting things about all of Asia. We were completing a four-week tour of Southeast Asia.  Enjoyed lunch in their restaurant sitting on the terrace overlooking the Singapore River.  Chose two Singapore specialties - chicken curry and crab chili spaghetti - both very tasty.
Ros W,85,Mar 2019,March 2019,30,Enjoy the museum but don’t bother with the Raffles exhibition,"I really enjoyed the rest of the museum, which was very informative but I felt the $20 I spent, on the very small, Raffles exhibit was a complete waste of money. I felt it lacked narrative, didn’t give me any insight into the man himself and didn’t give any backup for the statements made at the start of the exhibit. I also felt there was no flow to the exhibit and some of the artefacts bore no relation to the subject. Very disappointing in all respects."
GARY H,229,Mar 2019,March 2019,50,The must see exhibition,"In addition to a vast array of exhibits and display information normally available at this grand river side location, there is a very well laid out special exhibition called "" Raffles in Southeast Asia -revisiting the Scholar and Statesmen. This special exhibition costs $20 per adult and includes an hourly free and very informative guided tour. A must for all history Buffs in this special bi centenary year."
Chloe Lim,89,Mar 2019,March 2019,30,A great museum! But the Raffles Exhibition was not worth it.,"I've been to ACM many times growing up and it's always been a fruitful and educational trip. I'm writing a fresh review however because we went to the Raffles Exhibition recently and found that it hardly answered the questions about the colonialist's legacy! Instead, a lot more was said about the artefacts he brought back to the UK, as well as his time elsewhere in the region. The controversial questions surrounding him, including the ones used in the advertising material, were not addressed head-on.<br/><br/>If you're wondering if you should spend the money, try another exhibit in Singapore instead."
Posh Packer Traveller,143,Mar 2019,February 2019,50,A must - do not miss it!,"If you only have one museum to visit - make this one, the one! Great curated collection, it is intimate, ambience is beautiful and it's not overwhelming.  Great cafe nearby too - and it is not touristy or a playground with lots of school trip events."
mammamiaScotland,6,Mar 2019,March 2019,50,Raffles Exhibition,Beautiful building with an amazing array of artefacts. Guided tour of Raffles Exhibition was excellent. Our guide was very informative and enthusiastic and we really enjoyed it.
Brinda S,8,Mar 2019,March 2019,50,"For serious museum buffs, this is a must. Thoughtfully arranged exhibits provide a glimpse into Singapore's history.","The Tang shipwreck exhibit is incredible.  Look out for the straw cups in porcelain as well as the Hand painted artefacts.<br/><br/>Do take the one hour guided tour at first &amp; then spend your time leisurely browsing through the museum.  Guide books for every exhibit will provide you with more details.<br/><br/>Your entry pass is valid for the entire day &amp; you can take a break, have some refreshments and go back to continue."
Gelber155,198,Mar 2019,March 2019,50,A must to learn about the background,"This is, perhaps, the most interesting museum in Singapore. Besides visiting the permanent exhibits, you will have a chance to experience also special ones. Very enjoyable."
Haebee,615,Mar 2019,March 2019,40,"Good collection, well presented","Centrally located by the old Parliament House and the Fullerton Hotel, flanked by the Singapore River, is this treasure of discovery. We went to eppreciate the Raffles in SouthEast Asia exhibition, in collaboration with the British Museum, and found the guided visit most meaningful. It gave us insights into the motivations of the “scholar” and the human condition. It was sad that the opening up of trade and economic development involved violence and war, and deceit and loss of lives. A must see!"
LeeD0412,38,Mar 2019,March 2019,50,More to see than you think,Located in one of the splendid old civic buildings an interesting collection of artefacts well presented and explained. The Raffles In Southeast Asia exhibits looking at his life from a scholastic perspective as well as a statesman was very interesting. Well worth a visit when exploring the old civic area.
epic9990,136,Mar 2019,February 2019,50,A lot of informative exibits.,Museum split over 3 levels with several different exhibits on each level dedicated to certain periods of the regions history.  Guided tours at various times by the museum and locals do free tours around the museum as well.
Tsion A,"5,743",Mar 2019,February 2019,40,Nice,"Open daily, on Fridays half price from 7-9pm. Suggested duration: 2-3 hours<br/>The museum was opened at its current location on March 2, 2003. It specializes in pan-Asian cultures and civilizations. Current exhibits include Exhibit Raffles in Southeast Asia. Galleries on the First Level tell the story of Trade which begins in the 9th century, with the Tang Shipwreck display which consists of more than 1000 pieces of ceramics, gold, and silver. Level 2 galleries are about Faith and Belief: Christian art, Islamic art, and other ancient religion. The entrance fee is $20 and you can enjoy free lunchtime concerts. In the museum you can find restaurant, café and restrooms. It is 7 min walk from Waterfront Promenade."
tabhauser,564,Mar 2019,March 2019,40,A very good 90 minute visit,The Asian Civilizations Museum is a good stop to learn about the people in this area.  My favorites were the Tang wreck and seeing all those rice bowls that were on the bottom of the see for over 1000 years restored to look like they can used for lunch now. The trade room had paintings depicting scenes of early trade days along with some very good pottery from different places.  The religious diety exhibit is core Asian religion. Everything is marked well. I recommend the free highlight tour before or after you stroll around for what should be a total of 90 minutes.  Great way to escape the heat downtown also
Maggie W,10,Mar 2019,February 2019,40,"Great place for Asian art, culture and history",This is another place I love to revisit. Impressive historical objects ranging from fine porcelain to historical clothing (pyjamas!). Great place to discover the history of the region and the artefacts that are part of the heritage of Asia
Bob C,307,Mar 2019,March 2019,40,"Worth a visit, a nice museum","First thing, let's not compare this museum to the great museums of the world, but to museums in cities of comparable size and history. In that case, I found this to be a very good museum, good for a 1/12- 2 hour visit. It is a very nice building, and provides a very nice history of Singapore from an early trading post to a modern city. The collection of Chinese artifacts from the Tang shipwreck was impressive, as well as some of the items from Java.<br/>The entrance fee is sing$ 20, 15 for seniors, which is about the same as a drink across the river in Boat Quay so not a bad value. It gives a pretty good history of Singapore as well as a good collection of Chinese and Indonesian artifacts. Worth a visit"
wireless_in_CA,"3,807",Mar 2019,March 2019,50,Excellent Design and Curation,"The ancient civilization museum was beautifully laid out and rich in history.   I felt the curators invested a lot of effort in the design and selection of the exhibits and it contributed to a great viewing experience.<br/><br/>Admission was $20SGD with discounts for those over 60, students and children.  I was given a sticker to wear which showed security I was paying guest.<br/><br/>I joined one of the hourly guided tours which covered an overview of the museum but other tours specialized in specific topics.  The original intent of the building was to be a courthouse but was mostly left vacant or used as a warehouse until it was repurposed as this museum.<br/><br/>On the first floor we were introduced to a Tang Dynasty era shipwreck found in off an island in Indonesia that was full of well preserved ceramics and a small cache of gold and silver.  In the rooms next door we explored the different styles of ceramics with Asian themes from around the world.  A small cafe was also located by the rear entrance.<br/><br/>On the second floor we walked through displays about religions in Asia, Islamic and Christian Art, cultural artifacts dealing with rituals and a retrospective on Stamford Raffles.  The third floor contained one room with musical instruments laid out in front of a mock up of a local home and the others contained more contemporary artwork or ceramics."
MarMar584,60,Mar 2019,March 2019,20,"Not worth the price, lack of flow","I consider this museum to be one of the weaker ones in Singapore. While there are many things to look at, it utterly misses a meaningful flow. There isn’t any logic or sequence, rather, you see Buddha after Buddha and ceramic bowl after ceramic bowl.<br/><br/>No story through time, no focus on important events - just a huge collection of very old things. <br/><br/>With all the items on display, this museum has lots of potential, but doesn’t live up to it.<br/><br/>Additionally, the prices are rather steep. 12 dollars for locals, 20 for tourists. Go there if you are either a big fan of excavated items - or if you have nothing else to do."
Milen D,"2,990",Feb 2019,March 2018,40,Nice building and a very good and extensive collection,"I liked the museum very much, as from the part in Europe I live the Far Eastern and Southeastern civilizations are not very well represented. I like the Indian and the Chinese artifacts the most. The shipwreck findings are very fine. A must-see museum when in Singapore"
Middledene,362,Feb 2019,February 2019,50,"Very high quality museum, a must to visit","Extensive museum full of well presented artefacts covering all over Asia. They are well labelled so you can get around comfortably with the free guide booklets. There are also free guided tours which we experienced and got a lot out of the area covered.<br/><br/>It’s a great museum. However we found the staff on front desk, gift shop and cafe all poor."
meigingtoi,25,Feb 2019,February 2019,50,Excellent collection of artefacts from around the region,"Seemingly overlooked by many overseas visitors, this is a wonderful collection of regional artefacts with comprehensive explanations of the cultures behind them. It's housed in a historic building (former government offices) which has been carefully conserved. It's not very well signposted and can be difficult to navigate. There's so much to see that it merits more than one visit but sadly there is no provision for multiple entry so you would have to stump for a fresh ticket each time."
patinhongkong,485,Feb 2019,February 2019,50,High quality exhibits on the waterfront,"The quality of the collection here cannot be overestimated. Beginning on the first floor with the Tang shipwreck, the complete contents of a Tang dynasty ship wrecked off Java while plying between the Gulf, Indonesia and China, and on through textiles, silverware, totemic objects and stone temple carvings from the region, everything here is the best of its kind. When we were there, a special exhibitions attempting to evaluate the legacy of Sir Stamford Raffles, founder of Singapore, took up a large part of the upper gallery, and here a more diverse selection of artefacts including botanical drawings, ceremonial objects and  notebooks were available for inspection. It's a pity the entry fee ($25, which for those of us from Hong Kong and the UK used to free museums is a bit steep) does not allow multiple entry because there is definitely here than the visitor can take in in one visit."
LamN,"5,598",Feb 2019,February 2019,40,Beautiful and instructive,"One of my favourite museums in Singapore. It gives an excellent overview of religious and ceramics art pieces in South East Asia and China, all displayed in a tasteful manner. You can easily spend three hours here."
Beverley E,14,Feb 2019,February 2019,50,Not to be missed!,"An amazing museum which is so well put together and covers all Asian civilizations, showing particularly how trade developed in the region with maritime connections also to Europe.  Religion, religious beliefs and customs is also well covered and at present there is also a special Raffles exhibition.   The display from the Tang Ship was just stunning.    There is a cafe and restaurant within the complex and delightful area on the first floor where you can just chill out on beanbags and listen to music or read one of the books on loan from the local library.   Wheelchair accessible.   Lockers in the basement for storage of backpacks or parcels (20c/50c coin required which is returned on leaving).   There is also a gift shop."
taiwankeiki,15,Feb 2019,February 2019,50,Absolutely must visit  非看不可,"One of the finest art museums in Asia, in my view. Houses an eclectic collection in a stately old colonial building. Includes both folk art and sophisticated pieces influenced by Chinese, Indian, Malay, and British colonial sensibilities."
maria b,25,Feb 2019,January 2019,40,Nice museum,"Interesting exhibits taking place in this museum. Not the biggest one, but interesting to visit if you're staying in Singapore a bit longer."
197gabes,89,Feb 2019,February 2019,50, A place where history comes alive,"Housed in colonial style building, the place is a joy to visit. The admission fee is also reasonable considering how much the place has to offer.<br/><br/>All the exhibits are well curated, with plenty of space to move about. There are seats scattered around the different galleries to rest tired feet or for one to enjoy the display for a different perspective. The only downside is the layout of the place can take abit getting used to, but clear signage are scattered near entrance/exit to direct you around. <br/><br/>Be prepare to spend at least 2-3 hours to really appreciate what the place has to offer, get ready to lost yourself among the exhibits as each doorway will leads to more artifacts or surprises just waiting to be discovered. To complete to whole experiences do find out the timing for their guided tour, as the commentary from the guides are fantastic. <br/><br/>Since the place also houses 2 F&amp;B outlets; Empress and Prive, there is no worries of not being able to find a place for a quick bite while visiting the place."
ZahidahTifny,65,Feb 2019,February 2019,50,Religion + Raffles in a nutshell,"The layout was initially confusing and the doors open by surprise. Be sure to read the map/layout to navigate your way around. <br/><br/>The curation for this museum was excellent and there were many take away from this exhibition. I enjoyed the Raffles in Southeast Asia (Special Exhibition) is all about. I appreciate how the curators acknowledge William Farquhar as well. Farquhar’s collection has always been my favourite. <br/><br/>Additionally, I enjoyed the shipwreck exhibition and how the display of the thousands bowl was admirable. Amazing!"
Calif0rniadreamers,308,Jan 2019,January 2019,50,Educational in a fun way,"We love museums but we have a very special feeling about this one.  The display regarding the sunken ship full of Tang Dynasty procelains headed for the Middle East, which was found in 1998, was particularly interesting. We loved the other exhibits which drew together Asia in themes e.g. religion, family, death, rather than just present a chronological or geographical rundown.  We also enjoyed Prive restaurant just next door which was full of locals enjoying a variety of food at reasonable prices."
smw45,49,Jan 2019,January 2019,50,Don’t miss this,One of the best museums I have visited- recently revamped into Themed sections with a variety of tours<br/>We went on the Highlights tour - excellent<br/>Highly recommended
KGB777,"38,048",Jan 2019,December 2018,40,An impressive museum,"I came back here twice in December with the kids. With young kids you need to keep a close watch so that they don't randomly decide to damage anything, but it's still worth a visit for them. More suited for adults though and you're probably more likely to enjoy the experience without having to supervise young children. Peaceful inside without too many crowds."
maura_geertsma,3,Jan 2019,March 2018,50,A Must See for those interested in Asia culture,"The Asian Civilisations Museum is a must see when you are in Singapore. You can browse for hours, but even if you do not have enough time - a quick visit and an outside lunch are a perfect outing. For anyone who is keen to understand a bit better the roots of Singapore, its evolution and additional Asian cultures."
ranjanapathak,"1,453",Jan 2019,November 2018,40,Good display,"We were informed that The Asian Civilisations Museum is listed on TripAdvisor Traveller's Choice Award for Museums for 2014, 2015, 2017. Open daily from 10am  to  7pm. Entry fee is 8 Singapore dollars for Adults.  Display is on three levels of its beautiful  building. Themes are trade on level one, Faith and Belief on level two, and Materials and designs on level three. Visitors interested in Asian history will find it very useful."
Robert P,72,Jan 2019,December 2018,50,Take the Guided Tours,"My wife and I visited the ACM in December 2018, and we are so glad we did.  We have previously always passed this museum by when visiting Singapore, but my advice is to take one of the various and excellent free guided tours to really appreciate this fascinating collection of artifacts.  <br/>There is an excellent restaurant within the museum, so you can easily spend the morning and afternoon at this excellent and informative attraction.  We cannot recommend it highly enough."
Yang,23,Dec 2018,December 2018,40,New galleries,"ACM has added 3 new permanent galleries showcasing islamic art, christianity art and ancestral rituals. The exhibits are quite interesting as they showcase the mixing of religions with local influences such as a statute of Virgin Mary with characteristics of the Goddess of Mercy."
Cath G,15,Dec 2018,December 2018,40,Excellent exhibition of the Tang shipwreck,"Well worth a visit. Only S$8 for tourists and a good couple of hours viewing. The Tang shipwreck exhibits and information were excellent. Things we felt could be improved - signage throughout the museum between the sections - there is no natural flow so you often double back or view things out of order; possible audio tour of specific exhibitions to provide more ""colour"". These are minor - it was an excellent morning spent."
cpr2exs,"1,339",Dec 2018,December 2018,30,Interesting,While the museum has a extensive collection of items from across Asia I found the most interesting was their Christian art . They had 2 original fumi e which were images of Jesus and Mary used to weed out Christians in Japan as dramatically portrayed in a recent movie called Silence (chimoku).
Sonia D,130,Dec 2018,December 2018,50,Loved it!,So interesting and full of so much History - inclusive of Ancient artifacts.<br/>The kids (including the teenager) thoroughly enjoyed the visit and admission cost was quite reasonable.

Minouche5507,186,Dec 2018,December 2018,50,Always a pleasure,"Again one of these places that I am visiting everytime I am in Singpore.<br/>A beautiful museum, clean, good service.<br/>A real joy for the eyes, to see all the different periods covered.<br/>Always to short for me."
Voyager582973,21,Dec 2018,November 2018,50,so many cultures,"firstly the old colonial building is gorgeous. the history explored all the multi cultural asian persons who have lived in Singapore. it being a trading capital and had so many conflicts, military coups etc was fascinating, such a diversity. lovely air conditioned rooms and wooden artifacts/ pottery etc."
Rosalynde J,256,Dec 2018,November 2018,50,A gem of a museum!,"This museum is not to be missed, beautifully laid out displays and lots of information about the exhibits, we especially liked the display of crockery retrieved from a shipwreck. This area of the world is steeped in history through trading and the museum covers this really well, Asian, Chinese Nd European influences clearly displayed."
Cruiser40884972736,1,Nov 2018,November 2018,50,Wonderful afternoon delight at ACM,Beautiful exhibits in a wonderful colonial setting. It is a great place to learn more about Asia. You can take your time to stroll and stare.
Miliana D,164,Nov 2018,September 2018,50,A great Place To Learn About Asia.,I could spend hours here  learning about Asian history .It is an inexpensive way to spend a few informative hours in Singapore.
obsoperator,"5,985",Nov 2018,November 2018,50,"High quality, not too big","I had seen the special Tang Shipwreck show at Asia Society NYC, but it's bigger here where they own it! Very nice overview of Asian art. Not absolutely necessary for every tourist. My favorite - Performing Arts and Gamelan exhibit, but dark and quiet."
HeyKlein,50,Nov 2018,June 2018,50,Must visit!,"The museum is with good number of collections. Ticket cost is reasonable. The location is also with other interesting places and ""instagrammable"" spots in Singapore."
Kate A,32,Nov 2018,November 2018,50,Amazing treasures of SEA.,"This was our last thing to do on this trip. In a way, I am glad. It would be hard for the other museums to live up to this. <br/><br/>The building itself harks to modern Japanese minimalsm, so architecture buffs would enjoy this place. But inside is a treasure trove of some truly outstanding artifacts of Asian origin. <br/><br/>Each section has its own mini guide/catalogue to the items on display. The sections relate to ship wreck, religion, performing arts etc. The special exhibits were included in the very small entry fee. <br/><br/>My teen son enjoyed each display and spent three hours asking questions I'd never expect from him. He now has an interest in Buddhism and the role local culture has on shaping it. <br/><br/>Some items originate from the Roman Empire! The work done to present and preserve such precious works of art is world class."
Borsobjorn,27,Nov 2018,November 2018,30,On a rainy day,perhaps worth a visit - but this was my second time there but not that impressive. Probably due to my lack of knowledge about Asian history ...but not that many other visitors either..
Meow L,3,Oct 2018,September 2018,50,Great Art Place and Mueum at the Same time,Perfect place to enjoy Art as well as immerse yourself into a museum environment. Peaceful and Tranquil
Brian M,"1,570",Oct 2018,October 2018,40,Excellent museum,There is beautiful display of an Tang shipwreck from about 1000. All of the exhibits were very well displayed and described. Well worth a visit.
norfaraidhtalib,2,Oct 2018,May 2018,50,Educational yet refreshing visit!,"ACM has always been a place where teachers can get ideas for art lesson, be it on cultural aspects or artefacts. The stories that come with each artefact facinate my both adults and children. I can always adapt the knowledge gained from my visits to my classroom teaching."
TravelManiac333,39,Oct 2018,October 2018,40,interesting insigt into the history,I chose to go to the museum since I am interested in Asian civilisations. 3 levels. it took me roughly 1 hour.
Traveler O,585,Oct 2018,February 2018,50,"Showcase of Regional Civilization, History, and Culture","Excellent, informative museum with great exhibits and explanations of the region's history. Many artifacts to be seen and temporary exhibits covering the area's history. Fascinating display. Worth a day trip. It's also located nearby plenty of other sites to see."
martinhelmantel,201,Oct 2018,December 2017,50,Interesting museum with a broad Asian scope,Still my favourite museum in Singapore. Gives you a clear view about the history of whole Asia. The voluntary guides are amazing with fantastic stories.
Roving699790,10,Oct 2018,October 2018,40,Not too crowded,"Enjoyed learning about history and seeing the displays that dated back a long time Easy to do at own pace, not over crowded."

Jonathan W,108,Oct 2018,October 2018,50,"Small, but well curated","This is a very interesting little museum, contextualising much of Singapore's own short history in the millennia of religious and cultural change throughout Asia."
Robert G,4,Oct 2018,October 2018,50,Called in just to see what was on offer,"A pleasant surprise, hiding in an out of the way location<br/>Great displays based on themes, impressive sculptures, all providing a good insight into various Asian cultures<br/>Be prepared to spend several hours here"
Renaud M,204,Oct 2018,October 2018,50,A gem on Asian culture and religions,Wonderful museum with an amazing collection of art work extremely well presented and explained. I so much enjoyed discovering the three floors of exhibit and learning more about the richness of Asia through mainly its religious history. Size of the museum is perfect and the 1pm musical concert in the main foyer was an added treat. Great location and nice building just on the river across the Fullerton Hotel. Not to be missed
Mazmannan,"9,057",Oct 2018,April 2018,40,Cultural education,"The Asian Civilisations Museum is opposite the Fullerton Hotel. It is a beautiful building which has exhibits on three floors.<br/><br/>The exhibits tell the story of Asian civilisation through the ages. In one gallery there is a story of a shipwreck. Other galleries have exhibits of jewellery, ceramic and porcelain pottery, art and calligraphy, depictions of various religious beliefs etc. All the exhibits are beautiful and are well documented.<br/><br/>The museum is a place of cultural education. I would recommend that you take a guided tour. There are many additional bits of information that the guide will give you.<br/><br/>At the end of your tour, you will welcome a visit to the cafe which sells a selection of hot and cold drinks and snacks. I would recommend a visit to the souvenir shop too.<br/><br/>The museum is open daily from 10am to 7pm - but on Fridays it closes at 9pm. Admission is free to Singapore citizens and permanent residents. Adult foreign visitors have to pay SGD8 - but if visiting on a Friday between 7pm and 9pm - the price is SGD4."
susserl,8,Oct 2018,October 2018,50,Amazing,"We visited the museum last Sunday and had the most amazing experience. We went on a guided tour and Ronald, our volunteer, was simply the best. A few key pieces were missing (lent to an exhibition to take place in Korea), and it would have been nice to see them, but the fact that we didn’t really miss them is a true testimonial to how amazing our visit was, and how incredibly lucky we were to have a guided tour with Ronald. <br/>The visit was really informative and we got to learn all about the amazing story of the shipwreck that takes an entire gallery, and we learned a lot about History through the beautiful pieces shown in the different galleries, and the many religious cultures of Asian civilizations. <br/>We definitely recommend the museum and the guided tour, which was the highlight of our visit."
Betty G,32,Oct 2018,October 2018,50,"Great museum, thoughtful text","This museum is probably not of interest to small children - no dinosaur bones etc but as name says - Asian Civilisations. If you love ceramics/pottery, jewellery etc it's for you. Current exhibition is the Tang Shipwreck - absolutely fascinating and great explanatory wall text. In walking distance to National Gallery and then across the river to the Merlion - it's on the tourist route and also good if you need some air con time!"
Piglet47,274,Oct 2018,October 2018,50,Our second visit,There was so much to see when we visited the museum last year that we just had to go again this year. The highlight for us is probably the first exhibit which deals with the wreck of a vessel over a thousand years ago. The recovered artefacts are beautifully displayed.<br/> On the second floor the exhibits relate to the different religions of Asia and the top floor consists of displays of ceramics and a room devoted to the performing arts. Everything is clearly labelled and accompanied by information boards and free booklets.<br/>The café sells a variety of meals and snacks but be warned - the slices of delicious cake are HUGE! <br/> A great way to spend a wet day in Singapore and learn a lot about certain aspects Asia.
affma,366,Oct 2018,October 2018,50,Great visit!,Museum is simple but great! I did a guided tour with a volunteer who was amazing. It made the visit really interesting and great.
GunBali,195,Oct 2018,February 2018,40,One of its kind,Nothing special for this building.  It has good array of color which interesting for Photography point of view.  Prepare your wide lens and shoot.
Stacey L,188,Oct 2018,October 2018,40,Tang Shipwreck exhibit a standout,We stumbled upon this museum on a hot day and the cooling building was a welcome reprieve from the hot sun. The highlight was the Tang shipwreck exhibit. The museum's collections were varied and vast and you could spend many hours wandering around. The kids got a little bored so it would be great if they would introduce more child friendly an interactive exhibits.
BelovedBell,15,Oct 2018,November 2017,40,Asian History,Anyone who likes to get a glimpse of the way Asians lived and survived through times should visit - great place to discover.
ianshamshey,907,Sep 2018,September 2018,40,worth a visit!,"ACM is a museum  focusing on the historical connections between the cultures of Asia especially since Singapore was a port city integrating people from all over the world. Level 1 features the maritime trade, the Tang Shipwreck and event spaces. Level 2 features Christian and Islamic art and ancient religions. Level 3 is devoted to Chinese ceramics. It is worth a visit if you have the time to do so"
Jan A,30,Sep 2018,September 2018,50,A well presented museum,A great museum for a few hours if your interested in the history of the island and it’s surrounding areas.
Abiseshana M,4,Sep 2018,July 2018,50,A spontaneous decision turned into a great decision!,We attended the Angkor exhibition in July. The artefacts and information were very thorough and in-depth but extremely digestible. The route of the exhibition was well planned. It was good story-telling and we learnt a lot. Will definitely check out more exhibitions at the ACM!
AnnenJimEuropeTrip,173,Sep 2018,September 2018,50,Definitely worth a visit if you are in Singapore,"Eye opening without being overwhelming, this is a great little museum, well curated with some lovely pieces. I only wish the Islamic art gallery had been open."
Joanne R,46,Sep 2018,September 2018,50,Insightful,A beautifully well curated museum with many interesting artifacts depicting Singapore’s rich heritage.
hrtraveler,739,Sep 2018,September 2018,50,Even better than before,"Visited a few years back and was impressed with the ACM.  Saw it again last week, and it's even better; the exhibits have been updated and the layout of the museum has been improved.  Very much worth a visit."
Brian B,222,Sep 2018,May 2018,50,Fantastic.,"The highlight for us were the ceramics from the Tang dynasty shipwreck. It tells you about China's trading links with Middle East in the 9th century, and how it was the ceramics centre of the world. And the pots themselves, mostly just ordinary household bowls to be sold in Persia, were just wonderful, and there is a terrific display of a large sample of the 60000 recovered from the wreck. Why don't they make pots like this now. I'd buy them in quantity. I thought this was the best thing I saw in Singapore. Don't miss."
Sarah K,38,Sep 2018,August 2018,50,Very interesting highlights tour,"We took the highlights tour, and the guide gave us an appreciation for items in the collection that we may have not otherwise noticed. Very interesting to see how civilizations interacted and copied from each other-globalization is not as new as we thought! The signs are helpful and have good stories to keep things interesting."
Jacqueline121,47,Sep 2018,August 2018,50,So interesting,A lovely gallery: everything is well set out and very interesting to an art or history enthusiast... or just anyone interested in seeing how history has linked different cultures and places together. I am particularly fond of decorative and functional art. The exhibition of a ship's cargo from an 8th century wreck is very interesting.
JanuaryMania_2018,52,Aug 2018,August 2018,40,Personal favourite museum in Singapore,I went a few times to see different temporary exhibitions. Admission tickets are not so kind for special exhibitions and but displays rare and unique objects and artefacts. The cafe on the ground floor has a nice view and it adds something little extra on top of the museum experience.
Leslie E,2,Aug 2018,September 2017,50,Terra Cotta Warriors,"Nice small museum, at the time i visited it had a loan display of some of the Chinese  Terra Cotta Warriors"
Destination692856,2,Aug 2018,August 2018,40,Interesting,Close to city centre. Very interesting exhibitions. Showing how people of various races come together to form a nation.
Huangziyou,156,Aug 2018,December 2017,40,Must visit,The Asian Civilisations Museum is well displayed and informative for the foreign tourist wanting to learn about Singapore and its peoples' early beginnings. Well worth a visit.
Bernadette B,14,Aug 2018,July 2018,40,Well worth a visit,"As to be expected, very comprehensive, detailed collection of artefacts.  Their importance could be impressed on visitors more perhaps by an interactive way of engaging visitors - makes me think about the Wellcome Collection which really is innovative in how it engages visitors - this hugely important collection might benefit from such an approach if at all possible."
捷安 余,5,Aug 2018,April 2018,40,Small but delicate.,"It is not a very huge museum, but most of the time I can feel the curator always trying to make the exhibition being lively and showing only the essence."
David v,4,Aug 2018,August 2018,50,Great museum. Free for Singapore national day,Interesting and well laid out museum.<br/><br/>Fascinating exhibits of the trade routes from middle east to Asia
Tim & Tina_Y,445,Aug 2018,October 2017,40,Learn about the history of Singapore,"This place is free for Singaporean and Singapore PR, an interesting place to bring young children to learn about Singapore. Exhibition changes from time to time, with many interactive activities."
sunliner58,22,Aug 2018,July 2018,30,Dont bother,"Went there expecting a more detailed story on the Asian Civilization in Singapore, and 75% of the displays consisted of dishes, not enough variety, a bit disappointing."
sparkmel1985,31,Jul 2018,July 2018,50,Interesting and intriguing museum,"Great museum that looks at all the different cultures, religions and exports of Asian countries across the centuries.  We saw the Ankgor Wat exhibition from Paris as well as the normal museum and I learnt a lot and it was very interesting and different exhibit.  Highly recommend a visit - also has some great activities for kids"
Le petit chat noir,121,Jul 2018,July 2018,50,Simply the best,"The Asian Civilizations Museum was the highlight of our museum meanderings during our week long stay in Singapore. The museum is in a wonderful setting and it's worth taking a minute or two before or after your visit to sit by the river and watch the world go by. We were especially lucky because the ACM was hosting an exhibition called Angkor:Exploring Cambodia's Sacred City and we got to spend ninety minutes with a small group of people and a very erudite guide who took us on a fascinating tour. The rest of the museum is excellent, too. Level one is devoted to trade and the Tang shipwreck and there are some beautiful ceramics on Level 3 but Level 2 was the jewel in the crown for us. This section is devoted to systems of faith and belief in Asia and hosts an excellent collection of sculptures and artefacts that are beautifully presented and explained in English. The printed guide offers a 45 minute tour of the museum highlights if you're pressed for time. Highly recommended and not to be missed this museum is a real credit to the folk who manage it."
Samantha M,33,Jul 2018,July 2018,50,Fabulous Angkor experience ,"We are not traditionally museum goers but my husband likes ancient history and I was happy to wander around in air con fir a while! Little did I know just how much I would enjoy the museum and in particular the Angkor exhibition. We joined the escorted tour by a volunteer guide Aparna - what an absolute delight she was. Knowledgeable, engaging and passionate about history, culture and art, I don’t think we would have understood even half of the underlying relevance of the fabulous artefacts if it wasn’t for her detailed explanations and stories. An absolute credit to the museum and to think she gives her time for free. Would highly recommend!"
Chua Kian Soon,9,Jul 2018,June 2018,50,Experiencing colonial past,Classy restaurants by the Singapore river - a stop by place if you decide to take a walk along Singapore river.
Nihan E,15,Jul 2018,July 2018,50,I wish we could spent more time,"It was a great museum. We planned it for our last day before our flight, but it wasn’t enough. You can spend a half day easily. Also, there are temporary exhibitions. We visited Angkor Wat exhibition as a part of museum visit. (One week later we went to actual Angkor Wat in Cambodia, but we have learnt more about it in Singapore). Don’t skip this museum!"
fallfans,153,Jul 2018,June 2018,50,Brilliant museum,Well curated collection. Each item is significant and or beautiful<br/>The collection of religious statues was worth the fee alone<br/>Nice cafe to finish
Peter V,109,Jun 2018,June 2018,50,Excellent and world class,"This huge museum deals with s e asian cuktures. It presentation is modern, the objects displayed high quality. And therecis a lot to see! History buffscwill need a day. There is yetvanother partvof it in another area in town, both equally intersting. In shotbthiscis  Singapore at its best, showing culture, historyband heritage, heritage instead ofvtrying to play thevsmart city, what does that mean, anyhow?"
bhuck747,9,Jun 2018,June 2018,50,Fully worth,"It is a great place to learn about silk route trade, religion and traditions of all over Asia. Beautiful exhibits, fairly well laid out and helpful staff too"
Steelgrey96,7,Jun 2018,April 2018,50,Rare opportunity to see treasures of Angkor,"The museum is exhibiting treasures from Angkor Wat, lent by the Musee National des Arts Asiatiqe in Paris, which have never travelled out of Paris before. The exhibits are fabulous, presented sensitively, and leaves you with a sense of regret of how much South East Asia has lost through war and strife. The exhibit is on until July 22. There are also other galleries, such as the awesome Tang Shipwreck Display, which is worth a visit in its own right."
Huang Wzhong,481,Jun 2018,April 2018,50,"Well organized, professional management museum","one of the best museum in SEA regional countries, it's not only the proud of Singaporean visionary and leadership, but also worth for any other asean countries people come to visit this valuable place and learn each other cultural within the same venue."
t0nyk25,4,Jun 2018,May 2018,50,Just awesome,"The exhibits are very interesting, particularly the shipwreck. Entry was very reasonably priced. The displays and labelling was first claas. Afterwards I had a good coffee and a delicious piece of cake in the restaurant adjoining the museum."
Procaccia,328,Jun 2018,June 2018,50,An excellent small museum with a lovely exhibition,"When I visited the museum it had the Angkor exhibition that the pleasure of the visit was immense. The regular collection is excellent anyway, but with the masterpieces stolen by the French from Cambodia added immensely to the experience. The museum is well organized, the labels are informative and well written, the art is well presented with correct lighting and the feeling is of a highly civilized and well thought of museum. Recommended."
thaliawaters,80,May 2018,May 2018,50,A very very interesting museum,"I decided to head here after hearing lots of good recommendations from other travellers I had met before and it was definitely worth it. I spent about 2-3 hours here, there is a Angkor Wat exhibition going on at the moment which made it very interesting. Even without this event the Tang Shipwreck was incredibly fascinating! Highly recommend."
lynnjj53,41,May 2018,May 2018,50,Worth the $15 entry fee.,"magnificent building,  can spend many hours walking through and enjoying the history.  Do not miss this opportunity to see the history of Singapore"
glennysr,56,May 2018,May 2018,50,An afternoon,Loved the Asain Civilisations Museum. Such a very interesting History Lesson. Would definitely recommend to History buffs.
Katetherat,136,May 2018,September 2017,50,Fascinating,Beautiful museum very well laid out and serene surroundings. Great exhibition spaces and a lovely cafe for sustenance.
Min L,20,May 2018,May 2018,50,Best museum to see ancient Asian artefacts!,"Impressive collection of ancient artefacts, yet so well-organised and informative. The newly-revamped Tang Shipwreck exhibit was absolutely amazing, and so was the collection of pottery and religious artefacts. I was lucky to be able to visit the special Angkor Wat exhibition too, and am looking forward to seeing other new exhibitions in future! Worth re-visiting!"
PushExplore,"4,397",May 2018,August 2017,50,Museum for the art / history fans,The ACM as its better known is a heritage building and a must see if you like art/history. Its been around for quite sometime now and the typical British Colonial provides a unique look to the modern Singapore skyline.
gundamnsdk,65,May 2018,May 2018,50,One of the Best in Singapore,"Permenant galleries are filled with ancient artefacts from various cultures in Asia. Special exhibitions are held regularly bringing in collections held by other museums overseas. The special Angkor exhibition which I visited had an intresting display of objects from and relating to Angkor Wat, and the guided tour was enriching in helping us understand the history and significance of the objects. Will definitely visit again in the near future."
Aditya Cakasana J,152,May 2018,May 2018,40,Lucky visit,"When I visited the museum, I was quite lucky as they’re having a free tour covering their temporary exhibition about Angkor Wat and Cambodian history. The guide was an expert in Southeast Asian history so, she was capable of explaining even the very small (and most often neglected) details about this very exhibition. The only cons about this tour is that her accent is very French-ish so it’s quite a difficulty for those who is unaccustomed to such accent.<br/><br/>The permanent exhibition, I find it rather underwhelming, and its storyline is not as enjoyable as, let’s say, National Museum of Singapore. Still a good experience though."
JeffOP,337,May 2018,May 2018,50,"Brilliant building,","May 2018 see the Tang dynasty display, a shipwreck found about 30 years ago is a must, the museum displays the multicultural heritage of Singapore of a thousand years or more."
AnitaK22,129,Apr 2018,April 2018,40,New Exhibition - ANG KOR WAT,"It was a long awaited visit. The new exhibition about Ang Kor Wat was really good. If you are one for history and culture, this is what you should go for. The artefacts are from France so it is an exciting collection to view. It is paid entry for this particular exhibition. I liked it."
jtraub2,17,Apr 2018,April 2018,40,Too much to see in one visit,"This is an overwhelming museum, full of great information about the history of Asia and how trade between nations built it.  The signage is in English and well-done.  My one complaint, such as it is, is that there is almost too much to see in a single visit and the price is a bit high ($20S), but well worth it."
Eric J,18,Apr 2018,March 2018,50,My favorite,My absolute favorite museum. Has improved a lot over the years. Good special exhibitions. Friendly staff.
Finona68,225,Apr 2018,April 2018,10,POoor staff,"We could not get the staff to actually stop attending to their own problems and sell us a ticket to enter this museum.  We were keen to see the Tang Shipwreck display but sadly we were denied this.  Sorry, but they could do better."
Catherine C,23,Apr 2018,February 2018,50,Experience the culture,"This is a lovely museum that will take sometime to walk around,.  You can see all the influences of other Asian cultures and it helps to understand how Singapore is a melting pot of cultures."
Arrjun,225,Apr 2018,April 2018,50,Highlight of my Singapore visit,"When I asked around friends in Singapore about this museum, they were unaware. As were cab drivers. The internet came to the rescue and I am glad it did. To me, a die-hard history buff, the Asian Civilizations Museum was the highlight of my visit to Singapore. <br/>It showcases artifacts and historical influences that impacted South East Asia. <br/>There is a very large gallery showcasing the influences from India - Hindu/Buddhist and Jain, as well as from Sri Lanka. At the time of my visit, there was also a special exhibition on Angkor ongoing that added a special layer to the place.<br/>It encompasses Chinese influences - from ceramics to tomb remains. Also touches aspects of culture such as painting and dance.<br/>There is also a section dedicated to the world of a scholar. <br/>Worth a visit. Will take about 2 hours to cover it well. There is also a nice museum shop to pick up a souvenir from."
KW M,438,Apr 2018,April 2018,50,Great Museum,"As people have already said, the Tang Shipwreck by itself is excellent. It's the first exhibit you see too.<br/>Lots of pieces from all over Asia, ceramics, stone, wood, fabric, and everything in between.<br/>Good layout, clean, no issues at all.<br/>I think the Ankor exhibit opens April 8th, I missed it by a couple of days, but that would have been wonderful to see.<br/>Worth the time and money to go explore."
Dziauddin Mahamud,58,Apr 2018,April 2018,50,Product Knowledge of Asian Civilisation Museum,"4th April 2018 <br/>Such a good place to visit for learning something about history back then.<br/>I was impressed the way they layout the item and display with the nice information.<br/>Cleanliness is superb,security guard also friendly and helpful to show the right direction to exit from the exhibition hall.<br/><br/>Looking forward to come back again to catch up with Angkor Wat exhibitioncoming soon on this 8th April 2018 .<br/><br/>Regards <br/>Dziauddin Mahamud <br/>Lavender , Singapore"
Knorts,64,Mar 2018,March 2018,50,Tang Dynasty Shipwreck is amazing!,"If you are interested in ceramics, this museum is a must visit. I was blown away by the Tang Dynasty Shipwreck exhibit as well as the Buddhist art/sculpture section."
carpe_itineris,449,Mar 2018,January 2018,50,Yes!,This museum's exhibits are fascinating.  the Tang Shipwreck exhibit is unparalleled in wealth of information about early commerce and exchange.  Fabulous!
gpagot,196,Mar 2018,March 2018,30,Nice but need more display,"Nice tour of religions in Asia, nice display, very good exhibits, it would benefit a richer collection to display."
Michelle Z,678,Mar 2018,March 2018,40,Unique pieces and Shipwreck Artifacts,"When you’re in Singapore and it rains, locals may point you to shopping. Go to a museum instead. As the museum describes:  “It’s a Harbor of History, although the Singapore River is considered modest in comparison to the Chao Phraya, Mekong, or Yangtze Rivers. It flows less than 4km from its source near Fort Canning Hill to the sea, but has long been an important waterway. Themes draw from Singapore’s nature as a cosmopolitan, multicultural, multi religious poet and trading city.” It gives you a glimpse of how cultures merged and helps appreciate the complexity of the area. I stumbled on it walking with colleagues who were headed to get drinks. I told them I’d catch up and I’m so glad I did. Even though I went though quickly, it helped me see more as we went to Lau Pa Sat Festival Market."
Danielle M,54,Mar 2018,February 2018,50,Experience Culture,"It's easy to spend a vacation in Singapore in just a gluttonous display of eating and drinking, but I challenge you to look further and visit at least one museum while you are there and experience the rich culture. I loved the Asian Civilisations Museum. I learned a lot about the various cultures and religions in the region. A personal highlight was the display of the the remnants of a shipwreck. It's amazing how old the art was - and how still intact it was! Worth making the trip for that alone."
Ogi0,"11,594",Mar 2018,March 2018,50,Excelent museum,"Excellent museum, perhaps the most interesting in Singapore. Special interest presents the exhibition devoted to the various religions spread in Asia, located on the second floor of the museum.<br/>On the first floor there is an interesting archeological exhibition devoted to commerce during the ages."
Doris Y,18,Mar 2018,February 2018,50,Definitely a museum worth visiting.,"I was shocked at the incredible items they had on display.  The first place one goes is to shipwreck treasure that was discovered after being underwater for over a thousand years.  The displays were incredible with some items dating back nearly 2,000 years."
Talachas,115,Mar 2018,November 2017,50,"Southeast Asia should be title, great concentration of regional artifacts from different ages and great museography","Although not enormous like other museums of the kind in the region (National Heritage Museum of Taipei), its worth the visit, nice museography and nice places to eat nearby.  Also close to the National Gallery which is amazing."
Judyannechan,114,Mar 2018,January 2018,50,Lovely old building,The museum is housed in an old historical building next to the river.  It has a gift shop &amp; a couple of restaurants... one Chinese &amp; one more casual cafe.  There are a lot of Asian ceramics and pottery on display as well as a lot of religious stone carvings.  There are a lot of beautiful Asian handicrafts on display.   They had one main exhibit of this ancient shipwreck near Sumatra which was discovered ... very nicely done.  Guided tours are available.
JimSanDieg0,107,Mar 2018,March 2018,50,Really interesting museum to see cool artifacts and learn about Asian cultures,"Spent almost 3 hours at the Asian Civilizations Museum.  Very interesting artifacts, especially from the Tang shipwreck from the 8th century and the development of various Asia-originating religions. Highly recommend going through the museum with a docent.  The docents here are extensively trained (7 month program and only the best pass the final test).  Being with the docent really made a huge difference in our experience.  <br/><br/>After going through the museum, the attached restaurant services great brunch and sandwiches."
JSeng,453,Feb 2018,February 2018,50,Great museum to visit from time to time,Visited ACM after so many years. I am still amazed by the rich exhibits it has. As much as I can I will find time to visit Singapore museums in the future.
millidm,6,Feb 2018,January 2018,50,Nice,"It is do good that it is surprising it wasn't packed with visitors, but this does revise an excellent opportunity to see everything clearly. A chronology map would have been helpful."
Will W,54,Feb 2018,February 2018,50,Excellent Museum near Clarke Quay,"Well displayed, well-lit exhibits with plenty of information. Each section of the museum offers a free booklet that you can take to supplement the information provided for each exhibit. <br/><br/>The suggested route takes you first to the star attraction of the museum - the Tang Shipwreck. If you're a fan of ceramics, this is for you. Perfectly preserved 9th century bowls, pots, water carriers, wine pitchers, silver boxes, gold wine cups, mirrors - incredible to think these items survived almost 1,200 years at the bottom of the ocean before being recovered in the late 1990s. <br/><br/>You then pass through rooms of items created for the European market, or created in Europe with an oriental style. On the upper floor is a fabulous display of religious artefacts -Buddhas, Temple Gods, Mosque tiles...<br/><br/>Up there with the best museums."
Lucille M,50,Feb 2018,February 2018,50,Go of a Friday night and the cost is less after 6pm,"If you are interested in Ancient Civilizations this is a great place.  There was an amazing exhibit on Ancient Religions that was very worthwhile.  Not very crowded, even during Chinese New Year.  If you like museums, you would like this one. Not expensive."
Brad D,30,Feb 2018,February 2018,30,Interesting perspective on Asian history,"When I visited, there were two main themes for exhibits. Trade and pottery. And religion. I learned more about pottery and the history that it tells about trade and culture and history. And the religion exhibit was a master course in how religions have evolved across Asia and shaped nations and cultures. Not necessarily what I expected from this museum, but I appreciate learning an aspect of Asian history that I would be hard-pressed to find outside the continent."
martin w,60,Feb 2018,January 2018,50,This is a must for a half day,"This has an exquisite collection covering so many interesting artifacts.  The building is perfect for the purpose. There was an exhibition of porcelain items recovered from a shipwreck when we visited which may sound boring but was facinating and beautifully laid out, and so, so many other things of interest too.  The cafe is nice for a drink and food too. And no admission charge!"
RobininBRISTOL,"1,151",Feb 2018,February 2018,50,Wonderful ,Such a collection of delights in this stunning building. Much was new to me and so glad I made the visit
kayandrayj,52,Feb 2018,October 2017,50,Exciting and educational .,A beautifully laid out museum.Modern displays with some amazing artefacts . Happily sent a morning in air condition comfort. There was an amazing display of crockery from a shipwreck in a very modern way.
andrewjameswarren,442,Feb 2018,February 2018,50,A brilliantly curated modern museum,"Absolutely fascinating museum, which bucks the usual trend of separating Asian artefacts one from another( this is the Korean section, this the Indian section, this the Malayan, this the Chinese etc etc ). Instead it shows how via trade in particular , the various religions and communities have developed differently but folowing remarkably similar patterns. <br/>Brilliantly curated, with intelligent information provided for practically every exhibit, you emerge with a much clearer view about how much apparently  different societies have in common, rather than how antipathetic their apparent divergences might have made them. <br/><br/>Such a cosmopolitan approach exemplifies the best of what Singapore stands for. So it is utterly fitting that this unique museum should belong here. Not to be missed,. And the entrance fee is so reasonable that it permits multiple trips."
redsilver22,11,Feb 2018,January 2018,50,Keeper of Cultural History,This is a great destination for art appreciator/lover.  It has contemporary and historical works.  The tang Shipwreck is an amazing collection of crafted objects from 11century.  Visited twice to just see collection again!
Watsson,415,Feb 2018,February 2018,40,Nice little museum,"The ""sunken ship"" exhibit is wonderful.  I want a set of those plates for myself even if they're neither dishwasher nor microwave safe.  The rest of the Chinese pottery on exhibit is also terrific and the ""religion "" exhibit is very interesting.  Visiting is well worth the 3 or 4 hours you'd spend."
elscaramel,2,Feb 2018,January 2018,40,Excellent,"wonderful exhibits and very helpful staff. We loved every moment of the visit. This is a fantastic museum that presents Asian links and influences in trade, art and religion."
JackTJT,5,Feb 2018,January 2018,50,Light to Dark festival,Came here for the light to dark festival. The most interesting exhibit was the OH! exhibit where you can take photos in a kaleidoscope of lights
Marilynne C,227,Feb 2018,January 2018,50,Worth a couple of hours of your time,Minimal cost (8 MYR ??). Guided 1 hour tour at no charge and althougth tours are not my thing I was fascinated with the stories behind some of the exhibits. Number one for me was the artifacts from the Tang shipwreck found in 1998 and estimated to be from the Tang period (618-907). The ceramics from the ship seem to be in near-perefect condition and were on there way to the Middle East.
Rian T,9,Feb 2018,February 2018,50,Excellent museum ,"Excellent museum full of anthropological, archaeological, religious and art history content, in a beautiful building and location. The free guided tours are highly informative. If you’re lucky, hopefully Johnny will be there to give you a tour: he gave us an incredibly informative and intimate guided tour. He was clearly well-versed in the displays and brought his own (clearly vast) knowledge to bear in conducting the tour."
Austin_TexasRedhead,167,Feb 2018,January 2018,40,Interesting mix of cultures on display,"One hour guided tour was free, guide was knowledgeable and friendly.   Afterward you were free to roam and explore further.  Excellent display of recovered shipwreck items including hundreds of ceramics.   Stunning statues showing a mix of cultures, religions."
Diane G,177,Jan 2018,January 2018,30,Very nice examples of pottery and statues,"Located behind the Fullerton Hotel the museum is 3 floors and tells of trade between China, India and the islands of Java Jakarta and Singapore.   You can get through it in 60-90 min. They also have headsets or guides if you want a more in depth learning. $4 entry fee for tourists"
sharonr806,279,Jan 2018,January 2018,50,beautiful displays,The exhibits helped me put Singapore into context with other Asian countries over the centuries. This museum is well worth a visit.
Philip M,57,Jan 2018,November 2017,50,Asian Culture,A really interesting museum dealing with all areas of Asia. Many exhibits with clear instruction and background detail. Well worth a visit.
Bintangkechil,729,Jan 2018,January 2018,40,Surprisingly good,"I don't have high expectations before I visited this museum but this place has exceeded my expectations.  There are many interesting exhibits.  If you are tired, you can take a break at the Prive Cafe."
Shayne B,164,Jan 2018,January 2018,30,Average museum,Average museum - some interesting items but really a standard museum spent less than an hour there.  There are a few section that did not seem to naturally link together or lead you through the exhibits so had to check the map a few times.
Tob Ken,300,Jan 2018,January 2018,50,Phenominal,"Currently one of the best exhibitions I have seen anywhere, the contents of a trading boat bought up in Indonesian waters a few years ago"
KirstyKelly,268,Jan 2018,January 2018,40,"Nice Museum, good for a rainy afternoon","Not on par with the V&amp;A but the museum was lovely with some very interesting artefacts inside. They also have free little information leaflets in every room describing what is on show, something I have noticed a lot in Asia but not so much in Europe.<br/>However, as a warning to fellow Singapore residents, we were not allowed to enter the museum for free, as the website states, DESPITE having a full permanent residents card. We did argue a little with the front desk, but they were adamant that we did not qualify for the discount. This didn't exactly ruin our afternoon, the tickets were only $8 each, but obviously when you are not expecting to pay anything and then get told you have to pay, it sours the experience a little."
Barra G,62,Jan 2018,January 2018,40,Easy was to spend 3 hours,"Large sections of china pottery and the history behind the development and trade linkages.<br/>The special exhibit of the recovered Arab vessel with over 50,000 pieces of china is very good."
Sharon G,129,Jan 2018,January 2018,40,Worth a stop,Spent about 1-2 hours in this museum which was enough time to enjoy the exhibits. There are free lecture tours if interested . <br/>The admission is 8$. If you are an enthusiast in history you could probably spend longer. Enjoyed the cultural exhibits
Asianista,93,Jan 2018,January 2018,40,Ignore the Naysayers and Go,"I'm bothered that a number of reviewers seem to have so little appreciated this wonderful collection. Yes, due to renovations the current exhibit is somewhat small, though certainly enough to engage and delight the viewer for an hour or more. I will acknowledge that when I visited several years ago they displayed a much broader collection of regional art whereas the current display focuses primarily on Buddhist and Hindu art. Yes, there are certainly better and more extensive collections in other major world cities, but if you're in Singapore this is the place to go for some quiet contemplation away from the heat and humidity. There are a number of marvelous and unusual pieces here, especially of Buddhist art from the 2nd century on. If patrons want more detailed explanation and contextualization, they can read a book, I go to appreciate the art of religious expression not to get a history lesson. I would add that, while it will not blow you away with beauty, the artifacts in the Tang Shipwreck display do cause one to ponder the incredible extent of trade in the region more than 1000 years ago."
MimiVoyage2012,27,Jan 2018,December 2017,50,"ACM: arts, cultures, memorable moments","The ACM is celebrates the rich artistic heritage of Asia, especially the diverse mix of ancestral cultures of Singaporeans, brought together in this port city. <br/>A definite must see while in Singapore."
Kamaljit S,39,Jan 2018,December 2017,50,Hidden Gem - well worth a visit!,"Discovered a little by accident, but some wonderful historic collections. Spend a good 2-3 hours followed by lunch in museum restaurant which was excellent."
Esther R,657,Jan 2018,January 2018,50,Nice place,Well..  i come with my friend from Raffles Place red line mrt and walk about 10 minutes to get there. Walk long the river and pass the Fullerton Hotel.
Andrew M,"1,088",Jan 2018,January 2018,40,Very interesting.,"The ACM is not a huge museum, however, does have quite a few interesting exhibits. The ship wreck gallery is very well done. There is a restaurant and Prive Cafe there as well. Pop in and have a look."
SJVBeijing,146,Jan 2018,December 2017,50,Interesting displays!,"The displays were interesting, especially the ones on the first floor about the pottery recovered from a shipwreck. Great way to spend a rainy morning. Nice cafe for a snack or lunch."
cac258,136,Dec 2017,December 2017,50,We loved it,"This is a world class, beautiful museum. If you are interested in (mostly historic) Asian art, or if you are just looking to get out of the Singapore heat or rain for an hour or two, this is a great choice (to see everything you’ll want 2-3 hours). The museum is very well curated over 3 floors and has some amazing pieces, some from several hundred years BC. The building itself is also quite interesting, with old and new parts woven together. The special exhibit of the Tang Shipwreck was fascinating. Easy to get to right near the Fullerton Hotel, don’t miss this one."
Jonathan Y,864,Dec 2017,December 2017,40,Worth paying a visit,"Located nearby Fullerton Hotel, this place is quite a distance from Raffles Place MRT line. At that time of my visit was in this month ( December ). For the month of December, they are allowing free entrance for both Singaporean and forgeiner. The staff at the museum are very friendly and helpful. The staff will also give you a brochure on the map of the museum before you enter the exhibitions. <br/><br/>At the museum, you will see a variety of exhibition. The Tang Shipwreck was a meaningful exhibition. You will also see many collectables and antique items on display which is worth a lot of money. The description for the item are very well written and easy to understand. There is also a gift shop near the exit of the museum as you can stop by to buy souvenirs."
NancyLee13,9,Dec 2017,March 2017,40,A good way to know the history of Singapore!,"If you have spare time or want to spend a meaningful few hours with your family, visit the ACM to learn more about the culture &amp; history of Singapore."
Bgr_AO,370,Dec 2017,December 2017,40,Must visit,A good presentation of South Asian Trade History. Especially from China and India.<br/><br/>I expected also a bit Malay History but there is almost none.
cjb43,117,Dec 2017,January 2017,50,A great museum that has a good collection of interesting art,We liked all the displays and collections which are extensive. The museum is beautifully laid out and easy to visit. Many cultures are represented - just like Singapore itself.
Chewy70,28,Dec 2017,December 2017,50,Wonderful place for learning,Good collection for learning about history. Well designed. Lots of other historical building nearby. Lovely lawn outside to have a sit and view the river.
Wayne T,185,Dec 2017,November 2017,40,Good overview of Asian history,An enjoyable two to three hour visit can provide you with a wide ranging overview of Asian history and peoples.
BaselTourmaline123,67,Dec 2017,March 2017,50,Should not be missed!,The Tang shipwreck exhibition is one of the most outstanding exhibitions I've seen in any museum. Any visitor to Singapore with an interest in Asian culture and history should be sure to spend time in this museum.
gsrs,583,Dec 2017,December 2017,40,Artifacts from various parts of Asia,"The Tang Shipwreck is on display.  it opens your eyes to the trade in Asia at the time of the Tang Dynasty.   Also on display are various art pieces from various area of Asia- many of these are religious pieces-  some from China, some from Mynamar, some from Vietnam, a few from Thailand, Cambodia, , Sri Lanka, and a very few and very special pieces from Gandhara some from India.   Many are religious pieces;  others are beautiful porcelain., mostly from China"

Physim,545,Dec 2017,December 2017,50,Very interesting,"Interesting museum to showcase some of the culture and history of Asia. Was exhibiting many objects related to Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu faiths and very interesting"
SY S,26,Dec 2017,July 2017,40,Good museum to check out a few times a year for various exhibitions,The museum is a historic building from the colonial times and regularly holds thematic exhibitions which are interesting to fans of history and culture. The permanent exhibits are also worth visiting if you are new to the museum.
RFB,101,Dec 2017,November 2017,40,Interesting insight in Asian culture,The museum is quite spacious and nice to walk around. Free guided tours can give you more background.
JohnTraveller8,43,Dec 2017,December 2017,40,Some insights to Asian Cultures &amp; Civilizations,"Mostly visits to Singapore involve shopping, eating and more shopping. However, Singapore is blessed with several good museums including the Asian Civilization Museum. This Museum is very interesting in 3 respects:<br/>1. It gives a good account of PERANAKAN - unique to Singapore's culture. It refers to the practices of a merged Malay &amp; Chinese culture. These practices are still happening today.<br/>2.Displays of Multi Asian exhibits such Caligraphy etc <br/>3. Special exhibits are held from time to time that are not often seen in public. More recently, the importance of the Singapore River was on display.<br/>Its location is also close by Raffles Landing Site, close by the Singapore River where a great walk along the river is much enjoyable."
DavidSlager,98,Dec 2017,November 2017,40,very nice museum,"I went to this museum for the second time. Their standard collection was limited due to rebuilding activities. However the special was about the ""silk routes"" which was very interesting"
Marg13,16,Dec 2017,October 2017,40,Maritime silk road exhibit,Very enjoyable tour with a museum guide. I think I got much more out of my visit because I joined one of the museum's guided tours.
MDMITUL,13,Dec 2017,December 2017,50,Descent place to visit,Loved Museum then must visit and take photograph it as your background. I use my NIKON D800 camera and feeling proud of visiting place together with my friends.

empress_cherry,573,Nov 2017,October 2017,30,take the tour if you're going,"I both walked around on my own and went on the free (with entry) tour, it's good that they have the free tours because there isn't much signage, so without a tour this place makes no sense to someone without pre-exisiting knowledge of Asian history and art."
VALENB92,18,Nov 2017,November 2017,40,An interesting museum,"This museum is interesting to visit, you will see all the Asian Civilisation, you can see the jewellery, the plates, the coins, the costumes, all the story"
yptay,302,Nov 2017,November 2017,40,You need to join the daily walking tours!,"Very informative guided tour organized by the docents at ACM. The tour starts promptly at 11am, and ends within an hour. <br/><br/>One of the most interesting commentary was about the Tang shipwreck, as well as how punch was invented by a King who had more than 100million subjects."
lima p,3,Nov 2017,June 2017,50,Good place to know about the history of Asia and its people,"Wheelchair accessible, wonderful exhibits and very helpful staff. We loved every moment of the visit even kept young children interested and curious about the people, culture of Asia. The building and lovely maintained grounds are a good photo op ... Its a good way to showcase the diversity and expanse that is Asia."
Bucksvoyager,273,Nov 2017,November 2017,40,Good museum with amazing exhibits from the Tang shipwreck,"Several areas of the museum were closed for renovation when we visited which was a bit disappointing but what we were able to see was very interesting.<br/><br/>However, the standout room in the museum is the one housing the exhibits from the Tang Shipwreck. In this room there is an amazing display of items recovered from a ship that sank over 1,000 years ago en route from China to Africa. When the wreck was discovered tens of thousands of items were found, most of which were in pristine condition. The display is awesome because the items, particularly the earthenware bowls, look just as they must have looked when packed onto the ship over a thousand years ago. If you are visiting the Colonial District of Singapore make the effort to visit the museum if only to see the exhibits from the Tang Shipwreck."
embeesyd,176,Nov 2017,November 2017,50,Wonderful ,"This is a fantastic museum that presents Asian links and influences in trade, art and religion. Download the free app in advance to get additional information and to use with the 3D technology in the Wreck room. The exhibits are well curated and presented. There are free tours in English, so check the times before you go as they are worthwhile. It is do good that it is surprising it wasn't packed with visitors, but this does revise an excellent opportunity to see everything clearly."
George H,69,Nov 2017,November 2017,40,Good place to spend a rainy afternoon,"This is my third visit here and each one has been a real pleasure. At best this is an afternoon of entertainment. The exhibits are very interesting, particularly the shipwreck, Not being fully versed in Asian history this has provided a very good place to start. A chronology map would have been helpful.<br/>Afterwards I had a good coffee and a delicious piece of cake in the restaurant adjoining the museum"
Dennis R,261,Nov 2017,October 2017,30,The wreck room made the visit worthwhile,We spent quite some time in the first couple of rooms and found that it was becoming repetitive and so we diverted to the shipwreck room which was excellent and of interest to most.<br/>Entry was very reasonably priced. The displays and labelling was first claas.
awLKA,180,Nov 2017,November 2017,50,Interesting Place!,"This museum features exhibits from all over Asia, with detailed descriptions on the exhibits, and is a great place to learn about silk route trade, religion and traditions of all over Asia. Beautiful exhibits, fairly well laid out and helpful staff too. Ticket price is SGD 8 per person (they have a half price promo for Fridays, 7pm-9pm) so its real value for money! Fully worth it. Free Wi-Fi they offer too, but put your smartphone away and savour the real things on view."
Mark L,24,Nov 2017,August 2017,40,Spend your time wisely at the museum,Good place to visit. The place is well equipped with lots of information on the Asian civilisation.  I spent at least two to three hours looking and reading all the description.
Daph P,61,Nov 2017,November 2017,40,Interesting,Close to city centre. A cool quiet place to get out of the heat. Very interesting exhibitions. If you're tired of asian food the cafe is airconditioned and offers some European food which is reasonably priced.
120ronaldg,15,Nov 2017,October 2017,40,An interesting Museum,"intersting museum in a beautiful building, showing how  people of various races  come together to form a nation. very good ceramics section."
Danni F,237,Nov 2017,August 2017,50,Lot of history,"Really good to escape the heat and be in air con. Enjoyed learning about history and seeing the displays that dated back a long time. Very well displayed. Easy to do at own pace, not over crowded."
Asterix04,19,Oct 2017,July 2017,50,A must-visit museum,"The ACM is a must-do for Asian history/civilisations enthusiasts. They have especially a gool collection of cermaics from China. An old ship-wreck artefacts are also lovely. Overall great experience. Also, nice in-hourse cafe. The entire museum can be covered in a morning + afternoon."
V W,20,Oct 2017,October 2017,50,Excellent,"A wonderful museum in a beautiful building. Many interesting and beautiful items to look at at linger on. It is not crammed with items which is great as it gives you a chance to really absorb each piece and read the details without looking over people's shoulders. You don't need to spend hours and hours there to see everything and you come away content that you have had the full experience and have not missed half the museum as you can do with other museums. A very calm and relaxing environment. Good for all ages from small children to older people including my 18 year old son. Its location is a great place to wander around to see a lot of history and other museums and galleries, set aside the whole morning to explore this small but interesting area."
Vincent L,71,Oct 2017,October 2017,40,"A good museum, love the ""Trade part""","It's a little museum when you will spend some time on afternoon.<br/>I really enjoyed : <br/>""Tang Shipwreck"" with its impressive collection of intact items.<br/>""Trade"": My favorite place, you can really imagine the ""silk road"" and exchanges between cultures, empires and countries. I liked some object mixing the best of art of France and Asian cultures.<br/>""The scholar in the Chinese Culture"" was good, I would like to see more elements, it's a good starter to explore this theme.<br/><br/>This museum gave me interest in continuing the exploration of Asian culture. Tomorrow, I'll go the the National Museum of Singapore !<br/><br/>If you want to spend 2 hours, come there - better than Malls ..."
Laura B,70,Oct 2017,September 2017,30,Disappointing museum,"Unless you love ceramics, it was disappointing and we would have gone to a different museum. The museum has great potential of being a rich cultural crossroads of Asia. There were no textiles, no costumes, very little furniture. There was so much empty space that could have been filled with displays from other Asian countries.  The Tang sunken ship exhibit was closed for remodeling which was a further disappointment."
WiltshireYellowbelly,111,Oct 2017,October 2017,50,Lunch After a Visit,"Stopped at the cafe after a visit to the Asian Civilisation Museum. Got to say the food was excellent and service as well. Ranged from a stack of pancakes for the youngest to diy sandwiches for myself and my wife. <br/><br/>Highly recommended especially as the doors were open and overlooking the Singapore River,  lovely oasis after the museum visit."
Doug M,574,Oct 2017,October 2017,40,Great value/Goodbalance,"For a very low admission, this museum is great value. It is a great balance for those of us that want to read all the cards and those who want to keep moving.  The standing exhibits are remarkable and help you understand how pieces of art can help us understand economics and trade."
CorinGL,237,Oct 2017,October 2017,50,"Wonderful, will return","No sooner off the plane, bags dropped at hotel and I walked through the doors here at ACM. I was fortunate to have arrived just as a tour was commencing, thus I was able to truly benefit from what this museum had to offer rather than just appreciate its many wonderful artefacts. <br/><br/>Sadly I was dehydrated when I visited and only stayed for the tour, but I will certainly return to resume my visit. I recommend partaking the tour, the guide was very knowledgeable and interesting."
Anita B,104,Oct 2017,October 2017,50,Excellent English speaking tour discussing trade &amp; ceramics,Excellent tour!  Learned a lot about history of trade &amp; ceramics in this area. Ancient shipwreck of the Tang Dynasty was fascinating to see along with all the exhibits.<br/>Beautiful museum!
farnhogals,57,Oct 2017,October 2017,30,Not enough actual stuff,There are a number of very well laid out rooms which contain some very lovely pottery but that's it. It does have a an excellent cafe though!
943willems,7,Oct 2017,March 2017,50,Know your history,A very cool look-back on the trade history of Singapore and the South China seas that helps one understand many of the cultural linkages of south east Asia as well.
Phillip S,178,Oct 2017,October 2017,40,Worth a visit!!,"Visited the Asian Civilisations Museum exiting it fill in an hour or, but before I knew it, 3.5 hrs had passed. <br/><br/>A rich and vibrant museum showcasing local Singaporean culture as well as Chinese and Muslim cultures. Plenty of artefacts to look and admire, and well worth a visit. <br/><br/>Some of the galleries were under renovation during my visit, but that didn't detract from the experience and I'm sure the museum will be even better once they are completed."
MKFX,9,Oct 2017,August 2017,50,Clean layout with constantly changing attractions,"Had a really pleasant time here roaming about the various attractions and wonders. Marvel at turtles, squid and other marine life crafted from ocean debris at the Ghost Nets Of The Ocean exhibition - stunning art to raise awareness of ocean pollution as well as the Tang Shipwreck were all eye-openers."
skryf,4,Sep 2017,September 2017,50,Lovely museum,Loved the old ACM. Middle of renovation and redoing of galleries and hopefully just as lovely as before:)
CraigM88,166,Sep 2017,September 2017,50,Take the free tour!,"Loved this museum. There are some more rooms opening later in 2017/8 and the ones that are open are super interesting. The tang shipwreck is super cool. I'd highly recommend taking one of the free docent tours, the times for which are on their website. There is an interesting (I was surprised by how much) ceramic collection and a lot of other interesting points that mean I will probably go back on my next visit!"
HvonHagen,69,Sep 2017,October 2016,50,Showcase of treasures,"May 2016 (Apologies late review)<br/>The museum and surrounding exhibition buildings are a credit to the country. Shipwrecks and Egyptian bits from the British Museum.  Artworks and poetry by gifted 'natives'. In Tune with the Times, and We Built A Nation.  <br/>Yes, Singaporeans motto at the time was 'Going the extra mile to bring on a smile' and they did!"
maria d,38,Sep 2017,September 2017,50,Sensational experience,What an exciting and interesting museum. Thank you to a very knowledgeable and engaging tour guide named Vera. You are a professional raconteur and your delivery of the information on Scholars was so interesting. We could have listened to you ad infinitum. You cannot leave Singapore without visiting this treasury of artefacts of Asian Civilisation.
Labienus,337,Sep 2017,September 2017,50,Beautiful displays,"Nice building, where they managed a harmonious mix between new and old. Excellent displays, especially about a shipwrecked boat, nice little café as well."
dickonfotheringay,185,Sep 2017,August 2017,50,One of the best museums I've seen in the past year,"The shipwreck room is spectacular, a perfect example of riveting museography, and I suspect the Islamic section, once it's completed, is going to equally wonderful. Also, it's just across the river (crossed by a historic bridge) from the quay with all the typical restaurants, so visit before lunch then pop over for a bit."
"Dr. H. C. Matthew Sim, PhD",383,Sep 2017,October 2016,50,Recommend Visit by Tourists - Moderate size Museum but quite good quality,Review by Dr Sim. Interesting old Asian pieces. Recommend visit by Tourists. Nice collection of Blue and White porcelain but could be better. Not enough pieces considering that SIngaporean and Asian collectors have sizable Blue and White collections. Nice Peranakan pieces. Regards DrSim001
Barbara R,6,Sep 2017,July 2017,50,Very Interesting and a Worthwhile Visit,"I wasn't sure what to expect, and I must say, I was very surprised by this museum! Very well organized and a great building in general. The exhibits are very interesting and well done."
Shakeame,48,Sep 2017,September 2017,40,A unique nostalgic with different exhibits.,"Here you can a find a few exhibits. At the moment, the exhibits are Ancient Religions, The Scholar in Chinese Culture, A Space for Contemporary Art, Tang Shipwreck and Chinese Ceramics. There are some guided tours you can join at a specific timing. It is near the Raffles MRT station and Fullerton Hotel.<br/><br/>Admission for Singaporeans, Permanent Residents are free admission to the permanent galleries. Tourist is free too except for Special Exhibitions.<br/><br/>There is a restaurant called Privé that serves sweet treats and freshly-baked cakes. The cosy indoor space has a unique nostalgic feel."

leekokkheng,2,Sep 2017,August 2017,40,Get to know the summary of Asian History in a short time,Good place to visit to get some info before planning to travel to the neighboring countries to know more about their culture and history
Nigel N,82,Sep 2017,August 2017,40,Interesting information on the people who first came to Singapore,"This museum is larger than it looks from the outside and takes a few hours to get around. Besides the exhibits which are very interesting, the building itself is wonderful to explore. A great thing to do on a rainy or very hot day - it's nicely air-conditioned! But that annoying discrimination that happens across south-east Asia is evident here too - foreigners pay $10 entrance while locals go in free."
Serene C,21,Aug 2017,December 2016,40,Asian Civilisations Museum,"Conveniently located just 5 minutes walk from Raffles Place MRT, Asian Civilisations Museum is a place worth visiting.  Apart from being able to view the Ancient Exhibits, you will also be able to see a good display on Contemporary Arts."
EaglevisionLowe,278,Aug 2017,August 2017,40,Visit,Collection of local and regional artefacts in well laid out display. Interesting ASEAN displays and history of the region
wakaranaihito,24,Aug 2017,August 2017,50,A must see,"We were particularly impressed by the Tang shipwreck exhibit, but everything was pretty amazing. Well worth an morning or afternoon."
Drifter2769,16,Aug 2017,May 2017,50,Fabulous Exhibitions for all young &amp; Old to learn,"We went to the 'Ghost Nets of the Ocean' exhibition with the children and thought how amazing it was.  All the sea creastures on display were made from Ghost Nets from the ocean - which are killing our marine life - hence the exhibition had huge displays of hammerhead sharks, octopus, sea turtles fish - dolphins and whales - all made by hand by some amazing talented artists.  This was not only a fabulous display of art - but art that told a very sad story of what human's are doing destroying the ocean marine life by not cleaning up after ourselves.  Kids found the display amazing and informative and so did the adults.  If you are in Australia in 2017 - you should make an effort to see this travelling exhibition."

Heng How N,"6,790",Aug 2017,August 2017,30,First visit as museum,"Had passed the place many times but never visit before. The museum has 3 levels on Tang dynasty, trade and religion. To me it was the influence of Tang trading, Islamic,  Hinduism and Buddhism that South East Asia culture and trade."
patkhamoshi69,8,Aug 2017,September 2016,50,Explore the Richness of Singapore's Culture.,"Explore the rich artistic heritage of Asia, especially the ancestral cultures of Singaporeans.  This place focuses on the historical connections between the cultures of Asia and the world. Exhibitions are held to bring down magnificent objects from around the world. Enchanting programmes like the annual River Nights encourage visitors to connect more closely with culture and the arts. It is a place where you can unravel the past."
akosichingz,19,Aug 2017,December 2016,40,Enjoyable and cultured visit,They always have something special from different culture. Me and my niece really enjoyed the visit last year
David and Jilly B,40,Aug 2017,July 2017,50,"Wonderful, fascinating museum","This is a very well curated museum, full of fabulous, ancient artefacts. The written information about each piece was informative and  <br/>We enjoyed it so much that we went two days running!"
woolywombat,622,Aug 2017,August 2017,30,Chinese ceramics,"The name of the museum is a bit grandiose given that the collections are so limited in scope. The museum does not portray all of the civilizations of Asia. What museum could? It does have a good, if limited, collection of Chinese ceramics with some exquisite pieces I have not seen elsewhere. The Tang shipwreck is artfully displayed and a must see. Perhaps the museum will have more of interest when the galleries on level 2 are completed. <br/>It has a very confusing organization at present. We were told to start on level 3, return to level 1 from which we should go to level 2, and then return to level 1. However, we had trouble finding the lift from level 1 to level 2. It's hidden way at the back of level 1. <br/>Empress restaurant on level 1."
A R H,805,Aug 2017,August 2017,40,Fabulous Museum,If you only have time to visit only one museum in Singapore then this is the one to pick.  Stunning collection of ceramics and Buddhas from the region that are beautifully displayed.  The South Asia Islamic exhibits really gives you a feel for the impact of Islam on this part of Asia. The Tang Shipwreck room on the ground floor is amazing with the exhibits done in a great visual display - a must see!  This ship was wreck over a thousand years a go but had items on board that were already a thousand years old when it sank.  Obviously collecting antiques is not a recent hobby!  Highly recommended.
Jaclyn N,6,Aug 2017,May 2017,50,Tang Shipwreck Exhibition,I had visited to view the Tang Shipwreck exhibition with my husband a while back. The place is very surreal and quiet with ample space for you to move around. The best part is that you can actually have a good look at each exhibit without the rush of time and crowd. Placement of the exhibits and layout of the museum is wonderful as visible signages guides you to whereever you wish to go.<br/>I went back the 2nd time with my young kids too and they were engaged by the historical gems that the Tang Shipwreck exhibits imparts to them. This really made an impression in my memory.
lrjk1985,59,Aug 2017,March 2017,50,World Class Revolving exhibitions,"It's an ever changing series of exhibits here, and there are a bunch of great permanent exhibits. I drop by every quarter, and spend a lot of time exploring the museum. It's comfortable, accessible and has great food options nearby."
rearcardoor,493,Aug 2017,August 2017,30,Asian Civ Museum with 3 kids,"This is a nice little museum in a nice riverside location.  It doesn't contain many exhibits that are interesting for kids but they do their best to keep the kids entertained by providing a booklet with stickers and questions that does help get them through the various rooms.  It's easy to walk around and nice and cool, with elevators if needed to get between the 3 floors.  Worth a visit but not the most exciting."
Genevieve K,307,Aug 2017,July 2017,40,A must to get a glimpse of the Asian culture,"This museum was a real treat - when I was there, they had a special exhibit on Korea and I took the docent led tour.  It was creatively displayed and some VERY FINE pieces were included.  The shipwreck exhibit is definitely worth exploring. Just give yourself time to immerse yourself in the Asian culture - you'll certainly learn something."
blokototerminous,136,Aug 2017,July 2017,40,Must visit on every trip to Singapore,"I made it a point to catch the recent Joseon Korea special exhibit and wasn't disappointed. Informative and well-presented in the way I've come to expect of the museum. The free docent tour was also helpful and worthwhile. Remarkably, they allow photography (no flash) which makes the experience even more enjoyable. And the senior admission fee helps to offset the pain of having to pay for a ticket as a non-Singaporean."
Nkocak,126,Jul 2017,July 2017,50,A very good museum ,"We have been to this museum today and also joined the guided tour which was really good. Museum is very modern, well kept, has a lot of interesting pieces, highly recommended. There is a cafe downstairs which is also very nice."
Pacificwoman59,329,Jul 2017,July 2017,40,Impressive building and exhibits,The Asian Civilisations Museum is in a beautiful colonial building near the river. The exhibits are informative and beautifully displayed. It's great to get an overall picture of the history of the region. It was a week day when I visited and there was hardly anyone else in the building.
travel2findoneself,345,Jul 2017,July 2017,30,Perhaps deserves a name change,"When you claim to represent the entire continent of Asia with its numerous Civilizations, you better deliver...this museum falls far short with it's hodge-podge of galleries and inadequate pieces representing entire cultures and Civilizations...."
Daniel G,47,Jul 2017,June 2017,50,Wow. take a guided tour.,"Don't know how we haven't been here on our privious trips to Singapore.<br/>We left this to our last day in Singapore, between hotel checkout and our late night flight.<br/>Lots see, but do a guided tour, you'll get much more out of it."
Winstonthedog,613,Jul 2017,July 2017,50,Great Museum,What's not to like about this historic building and excellent displays of Asian civilizations.  The exhibits are interesting and displayed well.
Jacqueline B,22,Jul 2017,August 2016,40,Great museum in downtown Singapore,Interesting history and beautiful building. It is a nice place to stop to break up a hot day wandering around Singapore!
Jimmy168,296,Jul 2017,June 2017,50,"A colonial era building, not to be missed","In the hot &amp; humid day, this museum is a good place to cool down. The museum is spacious and a good spot for wedding photography too."
MabelJane,22,Jul 2017,June 2017,50,Fantastic museum with added bonus of free kids activities!,We visited this wonderful museum on a Family Friday which meant no entry fee and free kids activities. I think these run on school holidays so check the museum website for details. This museum includes a fantastic collection from a ship wreck that will interest the whole family - we spent lots of time imagining what all those treasures were going to be used for.  Located near Raffles Place MRT station it is also in a lovely part of the city.  Well worth the visit.
peterK801OD,17,Jul 2017,April 2017,40,Singapore Colonial past and the changing times.,"Taking a stroll through the corridors and hallways brings one to a time where our predecessors who have fought adversities, have put this little island on the world map. Check out David Marshall desk right there along the corridor once one steps through the main entrance."
Asia_suitcase,201,Jul 2017,March 2017,50,Great museum off the beaten track,"I have been to this museum years ago and it's still same good. Well designed, great displays, introduction and overview into the SE Asian history. Closely located to the Raffles statue. Good location. Great artifacts especially those Chinese sections upstairs. Artifacts like those aren't on display in China as such got destroyed during the cultural revolution. It great to spend some hours here."
Max B,70,Jul 2017,June 2017,40,A serious but beautiful place,"An outstanding collection in this beautifully recycled building, relatively recently opened. I always recommend it to visitors to Singapore."
Eric_WA,14,Jul 2017,July 2017,50,Lovely museum and intro to SE Asian history,"We visited on a Saturday morning and found that there were very few other patrons, which led us to wonder why. As it turns out, we must have just been early because the exhibits here are fantastic.<br/><br/>The museum has a wonderful permanent exhibit on the Tang shipwreck, which was a real eye opener for me, despite my many previous trip to SE Asia. The impressive pottery collection and beautifully crafted displays only enhanced the visit.<br/><br/>The most unexpected, and a very refreshing change, was an exhibit was titled ""Ghost Nets"".  This was an exhibition meant to stir our curiosity but with a lovely modern flair - we saw sea creatures created from discarded fishing nets. The displays were all created by school children, and must remind us of the fragility of our planet and the human impact on it.  <br/><br/>Many other delights await the visitor to this museum - I would heartily recommend it to all!"
Oby O,23,Jun 2017,October 2016,40,An Refreshing Modern Outlook Museum,"Happen to be there when they are holding a Night Event. The whole atmosphere of the museum was like a maze - every corner you can anticipating some new discovery. I must say the preservation work was well done - very clean, modern and contemporary. Highly recommend to people who are interested in Asian Civilisation from the perspective of Singapore."

will1thing,56,Jun 2017,December 2016,30,decent place,It is a nice place to kill about an hour of time. exhibits are simple and informative. it is not the most elaborate museum but it has enough to spark interest in the region.
Pearl_tan,31,Jun 2017,June 2017,50,Back to basics,Wonderful place to visit as it has shown us back to basics. A place where you will indulge in many types of different culture coming in through asia by trading . Routes were identified. Gadgets and goodies were recognized. Wonderful set ups done by the Singaporean government to make this trip an enjoyable one. Do visit when you are in Singapore.
KGB777,"38,048",Jun 2017,June 2017,40,Back after a long break,"Came back here for a visit with my 3 year old son, but I'm not really sure he appreciated the quality of the exhibits. The permanent galleries continue to be very interesting, but their appeal is limited for small kids. I think I'll come back again without the kids for a more comprehensive visit."

sharon456,224,Jun 2017,June 2017,50,A great place to visit ,"We struck it lucky here with free admission as it was the end of the holidays. Normal admission price is $15.00 for adults and $10.00 concession. We had an excellent lunch at the onsite restaurant and then joined the free hour long tour of the museum highlights. This was run by a Mary Scott, a volunteer and was excellent. We then wandered around the museum especially enjoying the Tang shipwreck pieces, the Chinese ceramics and Trade and the exchange of ideas. The ghostnets of the ocean exhibition was very special. Artists and school children in Singapore and the Torres straights had made turtles and fish out of drifting nets and made them into an artistic display of a very high standard. The museum is well worth a visit."
Christopher E,324,Jun 2017,May 2017,50,Very illuminating!,As a westerner visiting Singapore this visit to the Asian Civilisations museum was a very illuminating experience. We particularly enjoyed the Tang Shipwreck displays which exhibits some amazingly well preserved artefacts from the ancient shipwreck! During our visit the Joseon Korea exhibition was running and this also was very interesting. This museum ought to be on your priority list if visiting this part of the world for the first time!
Kevin T,272,Jun 2017,February 2017,50,A wondrous journey to the past.,ACM is one of my favourite musuems in Singapore <br/><br/>The place is very well curated with a lot of artifacts and rich histories from Asia.<br/><br/>One can easily spend half to a day journey through the well curated art pieces and learning the histories.<br/><br/>It is a must to visit for anyone who loves history and artifacts.
Ange Here,36,Jun 2017,March 2017,50,Excellent South-East Asian collections,"My favourite Singapore museum. Interesting collections of historical artefacts from mostly South-East Asian countries, with regularly visiting exhibitions from other Asian countries also. Check their website for info. Exhibition halls only on the 2nd floor. There is one lift to go up. Other than the lift, there is a majestic huge staircase. <br/>There are a few restaurants around it. None in the museum itself."

tostartnew1,5,Jun 2017,June 2017,40,It was a casual impromptu visit but fruitful one!,"Being a Singaporean for so many years, I never thought of visiting the Asian Civilisations Museum but my recent impromptu encounter with the Museum was a very fruitful and enlightening one. After an unpleasant conflict, I left home and went to One Fullerton for a breather as there is the Marina Bay Sea View. From there, I took a casual walk down through the Anderson Bridge from Fullerton Hotel and reached this white, old style building with intricate building structure design which then I realised it is the Asian Civilisations Museum. Without much hesitation, I went into one of the free admission event. It was a very interesting and eye-opening one. The event is to create awareness of the ocean pollution and to encourage recycling and conservation of the marine environment which I felt it was a very meaningful one because without such awareness, I will not be able to see the beautiful sea earlier when I was at One Fullerton. I felt Seas &amp; Oceans are wonderful creations in life because personally I feel peace when looking at the sea with the beautiful sky above it, it gives me the motivation to move on in life even when there are many obstacles coming along. Looking at the exhibits where the artists use abandoned fishing nets and recyclable plastics to craft out sculptures of ocean lives like fishes &amp; turtles etc. After the visit, then I realised this exhibition, Ghost Nets of the Ocean, is complemented by Tiny Turtles, artworks resulting from a collaboration between Torres Strait schools and local, international, and special needs students in Singapore. Supported by the Australian High Commission, the exhibitions are part of Asian Civilisation Museum’s Children’s Season 2017. It was really a great and awesome experience for me and I am looking forward to plan family outing trips to Asian Civilisations Museum for their exhibitions soon too."
WilsWong-WilzWorkz,38,Jun 2017,May 2017,50,Go Back to the Colonial Days,This is one place where you got the old buildings from the colonial era and the new skyscrapers in the background. The museum also holds a rich collection of artifacts to look through and is a welcome respite from the heat of Singapore.
nicma2017,5,Jun 2017,June 2017,50,Wonderful Place,Great place to visit when in Singapore but entrance fee is a bit expensive. Would be good if its discounted on non peak hours.
niarparamita,94,Jun 2017,June 2017,30,Boring,"As for me the museum a little bit boring. It Consisted of statues and historical stuff from some Asian countries. The collection itself is not a lot, I think they should add more stuff to enhance the soul of the museum. The entrance fee was also expensive, SGD 15 for foreigner (you will get discount if you are a student)."

When we were there a highlight was a display of the ceramics redovered from a ship sunk centuries ago preserving hundreds of dishes, enormous jars, boxes, etc. Other displays relating to singapore's importance on the centuries old trade routes are fascinating. A lovely museum."

lisatan188,42,May 2017,October 2016,50,A historic building renovated with great detail and taste,"besides the exhibits which differ from time to time, the building itself is already a feast to the eyes. restoration to the historic building was done exceptionally well with attention to details to preserve as much as possible all the external façade. internally, the feel is spaciousness and a feel of ""classic design yet not outdated"".  anyone who loves historic buildings transformed to keep updated with times must visit this place.  there are also a few good restaurants within this museum though can be pricier than our food courts which is just 5 minutes walk from this place"

For the ones who like to keep it all on paper, make sure you carry a notebook. This museum has strung together the story of asia and how the people have been speaking to each other through trade, culture and language."
Nick D,"1,248",May 2017,March 2017,50,Can't say enough about this Museum,we started our visit by going through the Tang shipwreck exhibit - which showed all the materials found from a wreck just off the Indonesian coast where the materials were so well preserved and were acquired by a Singaporean philanthropist.  We then went on a whirlwind hour long tour (it's a big museum) that touched on highlights of the collections (thank you Marie) but gave us a great overview (particularly for some of the religious artefacts).  we then spent another 3 hours ourselves.  What an amazing place.
Fst549,7,May 2017,April 2017,40,Good place,Easy to get to. Good exhibits. I am a local so it is free for me to enter. Can sometimes be quite busy with school children.
Derek Isaiah,9,May 2017,August 2016,50,Highly recommended for history buffs,"Went to this place on a public holiday. As a Singaporean Citizen, we have free entry for museums on public holidays. For entrance fees you can check the Singaporean National Heritage Board website for all the information on fees, which includes discounts if you bundle together tickets for other related museums. The museum is not really connected to other buildings via sheltered walkway so if the weather forecast says that there'll be rain that day, make sure you carry an umbrella (actually you should always carry an umbrella in Singapore, rain or shine).<br/><br/>There're a few ways to get here by public transport, but the most convenient by far is by train. Taking the train to Raffles Place or City Hall along with a short 5 - 10 min walk from the train station will get you here. If you walk from City Hall you'll most probably pass by the National Gallery which also is a great museum to take a look at, or walking from Raffles Place will take you along the Singapore River which is also nice on a sunny day. If you're lucky the walk from Raffles Place will take you past some Ice cream trolley uncles which serve delicious ice cream sandwiches.<br/><br/>The museum won't take you very long to walk through though, expect to spend about 2 - 3 hours max. at this place. Definitely will not take an entire day to look at all the exhibits."

These include China, Southeast Asia, India, and the Islamic world.<br/>the museum also seeks to promote a better appreciation of the rich history that has created Singapore's multi-ethnic society.<br/>The museum regularly presents special exhibitions that expand on the themes of the museum, and these often showcase magnificent objects borrowed from museums and institutions around the world."
Janet W,20,May 2017,April 2017,50,Very well planned and  appealing museum; a gem,"Though small, it is packed with interesting exhibits.  The size makes it manageable but don't rush through it.  I was especially impressed with their exhibits on the faiths of Singapore though the areas on trade were great also.  I spent an afternoon but even a shorter trip would be worth the effort."
Robert G,123,May 2017,March 2017,40,Educational,"Before visiting this museum I didn't know a lot about the history of this region, and as such I left with a far greater knowledge and understanding. I especially enjoyed the Tang shipwreck exhibit, something I was previously unaware of."

Robert T,131,May 2017,April 2017,40,Interesting,"We spent a pleasant morning at the museum.  It provides an interesting presentation of Asian history, primarily trade.  We enjoyed The Tang Shipwreck which displays numerous ceramic pieces removed from a shipwreck just off Singapore.  The ground floor offers Trade and Exchange in Asia while the second level presents Faith and Belief.  We enjoyed the visit and ate lunch on the patio at a casual restaurant connected to the museum.  The museum also has a more upscale restaurant, which we are sorry we did not try."

The collections, and the topical expositions are well curated and laid out. Specially enjoyed exploring the recovered artefacts from a sunken Chinese vessel - very well displayed. <br/><br/>The in-house café is nice (but a bit on the expensive side). Wish the elevators were better signposted and accessible - be sure to ask prior to setting off on your tour, if your need to use them..."
notacanada,891,Apr 2017,November 2016,50,Small but rich in artifacts,The ACM is small museum by the waterfront that exhibits treasures from the neighbouring areas. I was glad to revisit the Belitung’s wreck that I had seen in Toronto at the Agha Khan museum a couple of years ago. A must see for the richness of the artifacts displayed.
Seatroutfisher-1,449,Apr 2017,April 2017,50,A must for any lover of history,"The ACM provides visitors with an insight to the cultures of the surrounding area. Packed with exhibits from all around Asia, the museum is a wonderful way to spend a few hours in an cool building enriching your Singapore exprience"
Gerard M,445,Apr 2017,October 2016,30,Nice,"Nice museum near the river in the old area. Colonial building  to watch outside, and good exhibitions inside."
drjeff,492,Apr 2017,April 2017,30,Worth a half hour,Interesting museum but only for a short visit. Had some nice things but has a weird lay out. Enjoyed sunken ship exhibit
MRMOLLER,282,Apr 2017,February 2017,40,Nice,"A must see museum , the amazing history of this great young nation , really to be recommended when in Singapore"
CurlyTraveller,210,Apr 2017,April 2017,50,Spacious and interesting,"I like Singapore's main museums. Like this one, they feel spacious and beautiful. There is a lot to learn about local culture and history and the museum often organises events."
tony t,4,Apr 2017,July 2016,40,Interesting museum,There are always special a few exhibitions that showcase objects borrowed from museums around the world. Highly recommend!
Seema S,31,Apr 2017,March 2017,50,Beautiful Asian artifacts,Great collection of artifacts from Asia that showcase the ancient Asian civilizations. The Tang shipwreck exhibit was outstanding and helped me understand Singapore's importance on the trade routes going back to the 9th century
KevinLA310,268,Apr 2017,April 2017,50,highlight is the Tang shipwreck,"I didnt care too much of the rest of the museum, but the first floor with the Tang ship wreck and the artifacts that were found on it was amazing.  Its worth visiting for that."
Didi M,349,Apr 2017,April 2017,30,Expected more,"Hear a lot about this museum. It's notbad but we expected to se more exhibits there. If you have many days to spwnd in Singapore then visit it, otherwise you can skip it."
Orwin L,12,Apr 2017,November 2016,40,Must visit place for History Lovers !!,"good place to visit !!! has good Chinese collection  represented by fine Dehua porcelain figures, Taoist and Buddhistic statuary, export porcelain, calligraphy and other examples of decorative art"
Singapore travellor,50,Apr 2017,February 2017,40,Nice architecture and environment,"Exhibits change regularly. Some are free and some are paid. The building itself is very historical and is next to the Singapore river and Parliament house. If you are into museum stuff, check out what's on exhibition. Otherwise, just stroll around the area for a sense of history of Singapore since founding by Sir Stamford Raffles. Look for the Raffles statute and other statutes along the river. Some are across the river which you can walk by foot on the bridge, itself a historical structure."
Soloman Prabu R,17,Apr 2017,February 2017,50,For the museum lovers,A good place to visit and take pictures. Nice Architecture. It could be a good first date kind of place for those who got the taste for museums :)
Liz W,78,Apr 2017,March 2017,40,Beautifully restored building,This museum is lovely to walk around and makes a wonderful afternoon activity out of the heat. We really enjoyed the current exhibition on the Tang Shipwreck and the more contemporary gallery. The Chinese ceramics were stunning. Food options are good with a western Prive cafe and also Empress a Chinese restaurant.
Wattanai S,31,Apr 2017,April 2017,40,Surprise a lot,I go because I want to see the things inside but first let me tell you about the location of this place the location was beautiful and the exhibits are variety of them and I have learned a lot of history from other countries.
Fpchong,39,Apr 2017,March 2017,30,Newly renovated,It's used to called Empress Place which now renamed to Asian Civilisations Museum.  <br/><br/>Suitable for individual or family day outing and near by to more Museum within walking distance.
TonyS12,288,Apr 2017,December 2016,40,Very well archived artifacts,The museum kept many artifacts that reflect the rich Singapore heritage and links with many parts of the world.
SteveAdamson62,92,Apr 2017,February 2017,50,wonderful exhibitions,"Easily located in the CBD. The area around the museum is as interesting as the museum itself. The displays are world class, well laid out and well documented. The staff were courteous, helpful and knowledgeable."
Z_Bran,43,Apr 2017,April 2017,50,The Beauty of History,The Asian Civilisations museum is a must for the local as well as the tourist. Many informational exhibits about different history eras and a gift shop packed with local delights (and lots and lots of books!).
Edward M,180,Apr 2017,February 2017,50,Best in Class,"Singapore has a number of excellent museums but this is one of the best of its kind anywhere. It covers a much wider range of topics and themes in a thought provoking manner. A few hours would do and you can eat quite happily on site. Looking back, if someone had time to visit only one museum in Singapore, I would recommend this one."
Kat T,830,Apr 2017,April 2017,50,good exhibits; currently parrtky closed for refurbrushing to add a special exhibit on Joeson Korea,"Worth anything from 2-3 hours if seriously looking at the exhibits (60-75% open, due to refurbrishings). The coverage at the reduced quantity is probably a blessing in disguise -- if you had ever done the paintings galleries in the Art History Museum in Vienna (Kunsthistoriches Museum Wien) in full with 3-4 large paintings hung vertically up &amp; down a palace-sized gallery, you may feel vertigo within half an hour of trying to look up &amp; down each wall, even though it may have enough paintings (and Greco-Roman sculptures and Egyptian sarcophagi) to appreciate for 2-3 days. Perhaps too much.<br/><br/>Here, it's mostly sculptures and ceramics too -- so no need to look up &amp; down a wall. It's still very colourful and full of various motifs to savour, though, particularly for the ceramics. There's a strong pan-Asian focus in the ceramics curating so that the exhibit tries to have pieces from kilns from across SE Asia and beyond. Certainly, the focus on spotting variations in the technology (e.g. cobalt to give a deep, eye-catching blue) and motifs (e.g. Turkish porcelain adding very local elements such as cypress trees to the sort of porcelain which Chinese craftsmen would have never seen -- because there were no cypresses in China) is a very in-your-face in technicolor way of showing the spread of technology and trade. <br/><br/>Fully air-conditioned. Adding a special exhibit on Joeson Korea starting late April. Due to the construction works, two open galleries are cut off from the rest."
gingerlee13,451,Apr 2017,February 2017,40,Beautiful collection in Singapore,The Asian Civilizations museum has a beautiful collection of art and artifacts from the region.  It looks like the curator has recently redesigned exhibits so that the rooms are not so crowded with objects but have more of a story to tell.  I joined a tour and the docent was very knowledgeable and articulate.  The Tang shipwreck exhibit was fascinating and beautifully displayed.  This museum is well worth the time.
John R,44,Apr 2017,March 2017,50,Impressive museum,A very interesting museum in a beautiful building on the riverside. Be prepared to be amazed at the amount of artefacts recovered from the the shipwreck of the Tang. If you are interested in the history of this part of Asia then a visit to this museum is highly recommended it is light and airy and the items on display are well documented. Guided tours are available at set times. The staff are very knowledgeable and approachable.<br/>Entrance fee is very reasonable. Take your time and soak up the atmosphere of ancient civilisations.
murali8121,794,Apr 2017,April 2017,40,"Asian civilisation museum,Singapore ",A nice building along the banks of Singapore river housing a good collection of items to showcase the history and trade dating back to the sixth century. There are guided tours lasting almost an hour on selected areas which was definitely worth doing. Consider spending two to three hours.
Arielleeeee_c,55,Apr 2017,April 2017,50,Very good place to visit,It's a very nice place to visit and it's very big. You can spend about 1-2 hours inside if you're interested to know about Asia's history. There are some special exhibitions that will change regularly through out the year.
Morpheus60,351,Apr 2017,March 2017,50,Tang Shipwreck,"pay your $15 and be prepared to be amazed at the contents within the nuseum. make sure you visit the Tang ship wreck displaying over 60,000 items recovered from the sea bed."
Hwee Leng Toh-Heng,56,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Fine collection of ceramic and porcelain ware,"I visited the ACM on Saturday morning (25 March 2017). I only managed to view the galleries on the ground floor, but was a very enjoyable and fulfilling visit. The Tang Shipwreck collection in the Khoo Teck Puat Gallery is beautifully displayed and cleverly curated for the man in the street to appreciate the volume of trade and the quality of the craftsmanship in China and SE Asia in the 800s AD. The other two trade galleries showcased the fine workmanship of the Chinese and Indian craftsmen in porcelain, ceramic, gold and wood. I spent the whole morning there, reliving the memories of history lessons of my secondary school days. I will be back to visit the galleries on the second and third levels!"
Nancy882,264,Mar 2017,March 2017,30,Renovation underway,"If you have a choice, you may want to wait until the renovation is completed.  There seemed to be many empty spaces.  I took the English speaking tour and was very happy I did."
Frank S,305,Mar 2017,September 2016,50,In-depth look at Asia,"One of the coolest parts is the the Tang Shipwreck and the Trade galleries on the 1st floor. <br/><br/>Overall, you gain a proper understanding of Asian culture, particularly South East Asia."
geographyguy_11,510,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Brilliant overview of Asian trade and culture,"The ACM is currently half-closed for renovations but what is still open is amazing. The first gallery of Indian and Islamic art is very boring. The real gems of the collection are on the ground floor: the Tang Shipwreck and the Trade galleries. The objects recovered from the shipwreck are amazing - 60,000 completely different bowls last above the water in the 800s AD!! These and other fascinating artifacts highlight the complex international trade links in SE Asia at the time and are expanded on in the Trade Gallery. Here there are some lovely paintings of port cities and samples of the various export products from each country of the region. Other interesting but small galleries currently open are on Chinese scholars and porcelain. The building itself is also impressive. This museum is one of the better ones in Singapore and deserves a visit."
Anna R,571,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Visit the Museum for the amazing shipwreck exhibition,"Do yourself a favour and take a free guided tour (1 hour, at 11 am or 2 pm) of museum highlights.  In particular, the incredible  shipwreck exhibit - the shipwreck was discovered and salvaged in 1998, and 65,000 perfectly preserved ceramic bowls dating back to the 9th century were found and then painstakingly restored. This part of the museum will appeal to children as well.<br/>Bring your Singapore Airlines boarding pass for a discount."
Shelle Y,14,Mar 2017,February 2017,40,Great ambience,"A wonderful place to catch up with friends and family over the weekends, food and service are good. opt for outdoor seating if you like the view of the river"
Carolyn R,53,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Fabulous Museum,We loved this museum and would recommend to any tourist. Very interesting and so well set out. In a great area by the river and close to many other fabulous tourist attractions.
Rob A,41,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Great to get a feel for the cultures in Singapore,"This was recommended to me by a local and I was not disappointed.  I took the hour tour of the museum and learned a lot about the culture of Singapore at this museum.  Very close to other touristy spots, so the hour or two that I spent at the ACM continued along the river and then other museums in the area."
juleskarz,303,Mar 2017,March 2017,40,Bonding session with office colleagues,"We had a bonding session by completing task within ACM. This is a wonderful way to learn more about history and at the same time bonding with your colleagues. ACM is a beautiful place with friendly staff who are there to assist you, if you need help."

Rauf,15,Mar 2017,May 2016,50,Very educational place,"It's a must visit for someone who want to know much more about culture in Asia. Many sculptures, paintings, artifacts, and art perform shown every week."
shweta c,5,Mar 2017,December 2016,50,Very interesting and informative,I am not a Museum person but this one took me by surprise. There is so much to see and appreciate in this museum.The Art and Culture of various Asian countries is displaced beautifully. It is very interesting to go though the history of how Singapore was and how it transformed. A great place to take your kids.
Eugene1125,4,Mar 2017,April 2016,30,Its an interesting place if you are into culture and arts,"This place contains a lot of artifacts and things about Singapore's history. If you are looking for fun and excitement, this place is not for you.  However, if you want to broaden your knowledge about Singapore's history and it's background, then you should definitely check out this place."
Eric L,57,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,World Class Ethnographic Museum,"This museum puts Singapore in its deep historical and regional context. Not many museums anywhere take such a wide angle view (let alone in Asia, where cultural explanation easily turns political). It is rare that the diffuse cultures of southeast Asia get so much explanation. National museums tend to tell the conventional story-line of the dominant ethnicities. This museum, however, is inclusive and looks far beyond Singapore. Furthermore, it is modern and well-put-together. No doubt no expense was spared to produce this excellent museum."
vapp33,39,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,brilliant visit,would highly recommend a visit - great exhibitions in place and learnt a lot about south east asian history and culture.
Veron68,332,Mar 2017,March 2017,40,A visit to ACM and Afternoon Coffee by Singapore River,"Stop in to ACM. Joined a free guided tour to explore Buddhist Sculpture in 3rd /4th Century, picked up new forms with local ideas borrowed. Also Tang Shipwreck Exhibit, discovered in 1998 after 1100 yrs. Interesting! <br/><br/>What’s next? It’s time for tea! Head to Prive ACM to eat, drink and relax at Alfresco area, looking at Singapore River view and CBD skyline. Life's good, enjoyed 50% off sliced cake with a coffee ordered!"
kissane,956,Mar 2017,March 2017,40,A nice little museum,"I thoroughly enjoyed a couple of hours in this small museum, not far from Marina Bay. there are a range of exhibits, well-displayed and helpful staff. I was able to take a free guided tour of a temporary exhibition related to Myanmar (Burma), which was handled very well by a pair of tour guides. When I visited, there was also an excellent display of tea bowls etc from a shipwreck off the coast of Java. A pleasant visit."
cadamsesq,144,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Great museum and at excellent location,"This museum has a very interesting collection of Asian art pieces from various parts of the region.Housed in an old building, with a new wing, it's layout is a bit odd -- perhaps not well curated in my view.  But still a very worthwhile exhibit for all of southeast Asia."
rod d,73,Mar 2017,May 2016,50,Great place for South East Asian History,"This is a superb museum. Lots of facts about the development of South East Asia. Great collections of artifacts from Asia as far as India, and up to China."
MEAFaro,576,Mar 2017,February 2017,50,Great collection,"Within the theme is very varied, has lots of pieces, is very well organized. I particularly enjoyed the shipwrecked room. Take one of the guided tours and get more time to visit the rooms of your favorite themes"
TorgutPt,186,Mar 2017,March 2017,20,Poor Museum,"Just a poorly organized museum, static, old fashioned. Suitable for persons with a specific interest in the subject, otherwise to be avoided. A waste of time, I didn't even conclude my visit, I think. Can't tell for sure as the museum is so badly organized that I have no clue of the percentage of the exhibit I visited."
Sheana M,152,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,beautiful,this is worth a visit the museum itself is well laid out and the staff are very friendly. The exhibition was beautiful
Steve M,50,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,Don't miss Asian Civilizations Museum,Fantastic museum with an unbelievable collection. We saw the Tang Shipwreck exhibit and it blew me away. Trade between China and Iraq in the 900's. Good descriptions of trade in Asia and Singapore's place in it.
John B,266,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,Via part of Asian history,Enjoy the display of a shipwreck displaying china and porcelain that was made in 9th century that was found in the 1990s. A wonderful find and quite amazing. Also you will find pottery pitchers made 5000BC. Within this Museum are other exhibits from Burma.
Beverley73,177,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,A Must See - Wonderful ,We visited last week and it was free as the exhibitions are closing soon. We had a fantastic guided tour of the Port Cities exhibition with a volunteer guide. He knew so much and made it fun and brought an already superbly curated exhibition alive. We are going back next week for the Myanmar exhibition. The collection here is breathtaking. The staff are lovely. We picked up some very useful Heritage Walk booklets too at the Museum and have enjoyed 3 self guided walks already discovering new (to us) interesting parts of Singapore. Highly recommended. Lots of great things to do nearby and easy to get to.
Paul S,103,Feb 2017,February 2017,30,Disappointing,We had previously visited this museum some 5 years ago and although its good to vary the museum's exhibits we found it had been completely changed and all the history of Singapore had gone. We were very disappointed as we had really enjoyed our previous visit.
mirkwoodelf,2,Feb 2017,November 2016,40,Cool respite,Various asian galleries to learn more about asia and singapore. Lots of artefacts and information for visitors. Occasional events and temporary exhibits
priestesscreations,16,Feb 2017,August 2016,50,SUPERB BUILDING,"Enjoyed wondering around.  The building, I thought was superb.  I would call it quietly elegant, but a peaceful place to wonder around and enjoy."
PieBerry248,46,Feb 2017,February 2017,30,Learning Journey,Went there with my friends. Had a wonderful array of exhibitions. There was a huge rice grain there that the security guard make us guess what it was. The people were also very friendly. The architecture was impressive. Only recommend to those interested in architects and history.
Sharm C,21,Feb 2017,March 2016,50,Favourite museum in Singapore,"This place never fails or disappoints. Always an interesting exhibition on, well curated, creatively displayed, and not so big as to be overwhelming or cause ""art fatigue""! The focus on Asian culture, art, history and commerce makes it a great place to bring visitors to Singapore. Also has some kid-friendly spaces with activities for the little ones."
PepperRoss,206,Feb 2017,December 2016,40,Great introduction to Asian history and art,We enjoyed visiting this museum. It’s in a classic Colonial era building. There are many well displayed exhibits on various Asian cultures over the ages.  We especially enjoyed the creative display of the ceramics from the 9th century from the Tang Shipwreck.  Well worth visiting.
VEROUK,142,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,A real gem of a museum,"We've been to Singapore many times but this was our first visit to the Asian Civilisations Museum (or to be accurate our first two visits because we went back). Fascinating exhibits - particularly the Tang shipwreck - and well worth a couple of hours. We were lucky and hit a guided gallery tour/talk on our first visit and that was superb. It was free (as was access to the museum due Chinese New Year) but even if they make a small charge for the tour we'd recommend taking it. <br/>Probably not an ideal museum for children, although there would be enough in the Tang shipwreck gallery to interest them and I think some of the talks are directed towards younger ages."
218ccy,3,Feb 2017,January 2017,50,learning journey,"very nice place for family with kids, fun learning &amp; bonding.<br/>with group of friend also enjoyable, relax &amp; knowledgable trip"
han l,195,Feb 2017,February 2017,40,Must-Go of Singapore Museums,"This museum gathers interesting artifacts, memorabilia from all over Asia. Therefore if you are history geek, this is the place to go. Not only that, they have a great Live Band Bar at night called Timbre, on their grounds. The Duck Pizza and fruit beers are a must try!"
Pramoddesai,8,Feb 2017,November 2016,50,"Best place to understand the history, culture of Singapore and south east Asia","Museum is at very convenient location;Building itself is colonial and very beautiful, Staff is co-operative.<br/>Very good collection and arrangement is as per historical timelines.<br/>When we visited there was additional exhibit for Asiatic art and sculptures."

JiaYee82,82,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,Don't miss,"If Asia is of interest or part of your life there is sure to be something here. Not on the scale of some large museums on the continent,but some great exhibits..."

rtang41,14,Feb 2017,February 2017,40,History and Art Museum on South East Asia,"If you like history on arts, culture, pottery about South East Asia, this is one of the place to visit. This building is more than a century old, not much colonial buildings left in Singapore. They do have a cafe on the 1st floor selling local to western food."
R_A617,199,Feb 2017,December 2016,50,Worth a visit,The building itself is a former Colonial Government Office and is quite impressive.The ground floor has an amazing collection of objects from a 9th century shipwreck and also rooms devoted to trade through the centuries demonstrating Singapore's strategic position on early shipping routes. Displays on the history of Buddhism. At any time there will usually be a temporary/visiting exhibition also.
Serafin M,101,Feb 2017,February 2017,40,Worth a Visit,Welcome respite from the heat outside.  This was a great space to see Singapore Heritage and Asia alike.
Lisa199622,7,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,A fantastic museum with great free guided tours,My family of four was lucky to arrive just in time to get a guided tour of 2 of the exhibits in the museum.  The guide was incredibly informative.  My entire family (including 1 teenage girl and 1 preteen girl) left the museum with a substantial more knowledge than when we entered.
Łukasz,50,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,The place to understand root of Singapore,"In case your first impression of Singapore was ""huge shopping mall"", that is the place for you to visit! This is the place where one can understand where is Singapore's amazing diversity rooted and how it has become a melting point for Asian cultures.<br/>Check museum's schedule for free admittance. Also, there are free guided tours available."
bydefault,10,Feb 2017,January 2017,50,Great experience,"The ACM is a beautiful museum in an easily-accessible location, with very friendly personnel and fascinating exhibits.  You can spend as little as an hour here if pressed for time and still feel enriched.  Great place to be on a hot afternoon."
Happywanderer5309,123,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,You must go here! Well worth a visit.,"If you are interested in shipwrecks, statues, art works,   Modern Art in a great location and spend a couple of hours here.  There is a lovely walk along the river after you have finished at the museum and you can walk over to the shop houses"
Johns1951,580,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,Free admittance made it even better,Having read positive reviews of this museum we were keen to go. We arrived close to 11 am and joined a highlights tour for an hour. An expert guide gave us an insight into some selected parts. It is quite a large museum and you could spend many hours here. A highlight is the shipwreck containing thousands of pots from China.
TheEverydayTourist,26,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,"Browse through Asian history, culture and religion at this museum.","While not comprehensive, nevertheless, this is a well presented and fairly engaging tour of Asian history, culture and religion. <br/><br/>When I was there, the most interesting exhibition was the one devoted to the former slave of Magellan, Enrique de Malacca, who may or may not have been the first man to circumnavigate the globe. I learned a lot from the short video interviews, featuring various history experts and even history buffs like the filmmaker Kidlat Tahimik who made a movie about him (Memories of Overdevelopment). The exhibit featured what the Enrique may have worn, and even a detailed cargo list that Magellan made for his trip.<br/><br/>My only complaint would be the short film that they produced about him. It could have been a lot more inventively directed and much better acted. One wishes that they had shown the Kidlat Tahimik film instead.<br/><br/>Another highlight was the exhibition that featured the 9th century cargo found on the Tang shipwreck - mostly ceramic objects and a few gold pieces. I chanced upon the guided tour that had already started and the tour guide was extremely well informed about this exhibition.  He provided insights on how the production of ceramic plates and objets d'art flourished in Vietnam and Thailand when the Ming dynasty halted its own production of china for a few decades.<br/><br/>Definitely worth your time. Take advantage of the open house (free admission) from now until February 19."
mohtecht,19,Feb 2017,August 2016,40,Interesting Museum to visit,When in Singapore visit this Asian Civilisations Museum does give a overall view and presentations of the past and surrounding countries cultures.
anabelle,11,Feb 2017,December 2016,50,Brilliant,"Spent a good 4 hours here, and still felt like it wasn't enough! Followed a free tour, and got in for free as it was in December. The volunteer tour guide, sorry I forgot her name (28/12/16 11am), was lively and informative. The entire museum is impressive, the exhibits and the layout are done so well. I love museums so this is definitely a good place to visit if you love history. I would have paid to get in here."
Vivianne_singapore,68,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,the most interesting museum in Singapore,"You have to visit the ACM situated in a beautiful location in Empress Place opposite the Fullerton Hotel, close to the National Gallery and the Parliament. You can walk along the river before visiting the Museum. From now until March 5th, the entrance is free for everyone. Even the 2 new temporary exhibitions are free, Port cities and Cities and Kings about ancient reasures from Myanmar. You have free guided tours every day at 11 am, 2pm. Really worth a visit!"
jbltd,56,Feb 2017,January 2017,50,A very fine Museum and excellent tours included,"The Asian Civilisations Museum was one of the highlights of my recent trip. Once I purchased admission I was given the times of free conducted tours of a variety of areas and galleries. I chose to take the Trade Gallery tour and it was very worthwhile. I particularly enjoyed the Shipwreck Gallery with its dazzling ninth century ceramics discovered off the coast of Sumatra in 1998. Simply lovely artifacts, with excellent displays. There is an excellent cafe off the Main lobby and I had an excellent lunch. Do put this museum on your list of "" must see"" sites. it is really good."
ljcl,13,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,Great Museum,The sunken treasure exhibit was fantastic and extremely well displayed.  Loved the ceramic room.  Special exhibit on loan from Vietnam was terrific.  <br/><br/>Beautiful building on 3 levels and very well done.  Staff in each room were extremely helpful and offered information without being asked.<br/><br/>Cabbie recommended we go here rather than National Museum of Singapore and we are really happy that we took his advice
suesalford,361,Jan 2017,January 2017,40,Thoroughly enjoyable and really informative,"We found this to be one of the most interesting museums we have visited because it really challenged our western centric view of history and the development of civilisation. A fascinating description of the many different cultures in the region especially the development of Indonesian cultures. With many artefacts and themed areas, you can spend a considerable period of time here if you like gathering lots of knowledge. Like the other Singapore museums, we found the staff accessible and helpful. The museum has all the facilities you would expect and is housed in an impressive old colonial building."
Aethelred,832,Jan 2017,January 2017,50,Excellent Asiatica museum,"with its own, Singaporean perspective - and contrary to some reviews here, I find it exceptionally well-curated.  The displays are also aesthetically thought through without being self-important (as in the MAK in Vienna, say); I think it compares well with the East and Southeast Asian divisions in the V&amp;A in London and - if smaller - with the Guimet in Paris.  It is not comprehensive, nor meant to be, but many of the pieces are of very high quality, such as Chinese porcelain and the excellent (if biased) display on Imperial Chinese scholar-poet-bureaucrats.  The shop is disappointing.  Altogether a nice, very pleasant experience."
Janet R,128,Jan 2017,January 2017,50,Unique,This museum has an interesting collection of artifacts from SIngapore. The ancient pottery was  intesesting.
berenicewatersm,161,Jan 2017,January 2017,50,beautiful building with a cafeteria and a great museum collection,Lovely collection and a great exhibition on a shipwerck which had goods from around the world from the Asian trade route <br/>Free on public holidays. Nice cafeteria with a wide selection of very good portions Asian dishes with river view.
2torontotraveller,"1,957",Jan 2017,January 2017,50,Another Great Museum,"I went to this museum as it is a short walk from the famous Singapore Sea Lion Fountain.  It is in a beautiful building that has been restored and adapted for this museum.  Since we had the Singapore Tourist Card we were able to see the permanent collections for $6 SGD instead of $23 SGD.  <br/><br/>We spent about 3 hours in the museum.  It specializes in the material history of some of the ethnic groups that live in Singapore.  Namely SE, South and West Asia as well as China.  The exhibits on the Tang shipwreck and Trade were very well done.  I also enjoyed the Chinese ceramics on the 3rd floor.<br/><br/>The museum also has a cafeteria if you wish to get a snack or a light lunch."
Mareuil81,41,Jan 2017,January 2017,50,Dont miss the Changsha bowls,The Asian Civilisations Museum was a highlight of our stay in Singapore. The museum is superbly laid out in an impressive building. The Changsha bowls alone were worth the visit and the way they are displayed is impressive. Also definitely try a guided tour - the volunteers who take these are well read and enthusiastic and add to the enjoyment particularly if you are short of time.
ChrissyLew,17,Jan 2017,January 2017,20,Diappointing given the rave reviews (and price),"There some interesting pieces on display, but I don't think the rooms are particularly well-curated and given its reputation the collection is quite small. As mentioned in other reviews signage is not good and I did have to retrace my steps a few times. At S$23 for non-residents is very expensive for what's on offer. I have seen better Asian sections to museums in Europe."
two5kid,309,Jan 2017,October 2016,40,Nice Museum,"There are permanent and temporary exhibitions at this museum which might sometimes require the visitor to pay more, but I would say, go for it. The museum isn't that big but it packs itself with the items on display. We were there when there was a display of a Ming Dynasty ship and the porcelain wares found on the sunken ship. They displayed each and every porcelain in a wave like pattern. That takes time and effort."
wickedpinni,418,Jan 2017,January 2017,50,Lovely ,The display was various. Loved the contemporary pieces on the top level outside. The detail behind the work was very moving. The artifacts were both beautiful and amazing.
Ronald W,95,Jan 2017,January 2017,40,"Empress resturant at the museum, good for museum resturant",Invited to a party at the empress resturant at the museum and was pleasantly surprised at the food and wine selections. The location is a gorgeous waterfront venue in the museum. The staff were very attentive and the food better than your average museum resturant. Was a worthwhile and enjoyable experience
Astghik M,10,Jan 2017,December 2016,50,Very interesting,"Very interesting museum with permanent and temporary exhibitions. When we visited it, someone approached us and offered free guidance, which was very informative, helpful and interesting. Definitely worth visiting."
keentraveller27,382,Jan 2017,December 2016,40,Interesting and worthy,"This museum is very centrally located just opposite the canal and opposite the famous Fullerton Hotel. The tour starts with the Tang Ship wreck gallery and a map of all the ceramic kilns along China coast found in Singapore.Gives an indication of trade routes. It has broad layouts on the ground, first and second floor. The directions are very poor so sometimes one goes through the entry and exit and sees the same gallery twice. The galleries include Ceramics from China, Ancient treasures from Myanmar,grain of rice and other interesting artifacts from ancient India. Definitely worth a visit for the exhibits."
flowerpower_9,148,Jan 2017,December 2016,50,Good if Singapore is your only stop in Asia,"An overview of Asian civilisations. Free when we visited, would have paid for it though. <br/>After walking around the air conditioned rooms you can sit in or outside at the cafe. <br/>Shop for souvenirs too"
Globe Trotter,125,Jan 2017,January 2017,30,Was disappointed...,"I was really looking forward to this museum, but have to say that it was probably the worst Asian museum I have seen. Many countries outside of Asia have better Asian museums than this! Not sure why the rating is so high... must have been the first Asian museum that they have seen."
c3dr0n,1,Jan 2017,January 2017,30,Disappointing,"Having read about the great collections at the ACM and having a great interest in art, societies and Asia, this museum was actually one of the main reasons why I decided to visit Singapore on a recent trip to the region. Unfortunately, I found it quite disappointing. <br/><br/>The pieces on display are indeed interesting. However, as others have already mentioned before, the rooms are not particularly well-curated, the size of the accessible collection is rather small for its reputation (maybe the museum is still being renovated?) and signage within the museum is not very clear: I got lost a few times and did't know whether I had already seen everything or whether I was still at the beginning of the visit.<br/><br/>Given the quality and the size of the exhibition, the entrance fee of S$23 for non-residents is ridiculously overpriced."
Arkaan,6,Jan 2017,September 2016,40,Zip through or go at easy Pace - Great place to go with Kids,"As the name suggests, all Asia countries history and heritage covered here. From old rare coins of the various Empires and Dynasties to weapons &amp; attire samples all here. For the entry fee it seriously is nice &amp; cool place to go on a hot sunny lazy afternoon.<br/>Super educational and as an adult just reminds me of all the history textbooks I read in high school."
Professional-Pilgrim,"1,385",Jan 2017,January 2017,50,Another amazing Singaporean museum,This is yet another world-class museum in this amazing city. Fantastic exhibits; each one better than the last. Especially the Tang shipwreck. Detailed brochures available for each gallery.
Yammy_12,136,Jan 2017,November 2016,50,A great piece of Architecture,"This museum has found itself a fitting home in this beautiful colonial era building. Perfectly renovated in the inside and well preserved on the outside, the museum exhibitions are very interesting and informative. Absolutely perfect way to spend a hot humid afternoon in Singapore. Keep about a good hour or two depending on the exhibition at the time."
Adrian010613,16,Jan 2017,June 2016,50,Amazing Old and Modern Structures,A very nice place if you want to have a historical background pf Singapore. The structures are very impressive with both old and modern design combined. There is a Big park nearby which is very refreshing for tourist.
Steph S,7,Jan 2017,January 2017,30,Worth a visit,"Good place to spend some time when too hot or raining in Singapore. Good for those interested in Asian history. Very quiet, appeals to most."
shri5,344,Jan 2017,December 2016,40,Nice multi-cultural cultural attraction,"This museum mirrors the civilizations of different peoples who have made Singapore their home. So there are more than 1000 artifacts from West Asia, South East Asia and China"
realessence,264,Jan 2017,January 2017,30,Traditional museum,"It's a good museum located inside a beautiful historical building. However, the display style is a little too traditional and not so much interactive. I guess, adults who are interested in Asian history would probably enjoy this place more than younger people."
damienlee112,20,Jan 2017,July 2016,50,great place to hang out,had a few hours to kill and this was one of the best impromptu choices we made.. it was not too pricey for the entrance fee.. but we gain a lot and we got a little more cultured a long the way.. great place..
Winfried T,53,Jan 2017,February 2016,50,Really great museum and still improving ,This museum is already because of the coverage of many Asian civilisations highly fascinating! But they are working on a modernisation of their whole concept and the part that was already finished was extremely well done and appropriate for all!
Peter R,779,Jan 2017,January 2017,40,Lovely museum that's a work in progress,"The ACM, housed in a beautiful, historic building on the river, is a wonderful venue that provides a plenary and relaxing museum experience.  Particularly noteworthy is the superb display of pieces from the Tang shipwreck, a world class synoptic installation of objects that gives the viewer insight into the extensive trade routes of the 9th century. It's truly breathtaking.  <br/><br/>Other galleries are less inspired.  Some offer a motley array of pieces of varied quality.  Masterpieces are jumbled up with mediocre works which speak to a lack of proper curatorial editing.  Space is also employed in a rather odd way and lighting too could use some help.  Coherence and flow, both aesthetic and intellectual, are hallmarks of a great museum.  The ACM is well on its way, but needs a more solid and cogent vision of just what it's trying to be, both with respect to exhibitions and the permanent collection. <br/><br/>The restaurant is very good and offers a delightful oasis for pleasurable eating.  Service there is also excellent."
Rosie B,155,Jan 2017,December 2016,50,Fantastic museum,"Lovely building, fantastic items, great historical detail &amp; a lovely restaurant where we had a tea break during our visit and dinner at the end. Well worthy of your time."
glencove1,101,Jan 2017,December 2016,50,Wonderful hotel right across from Fullerton Hotel,"I went there twice. They have Tang Dynasty horses and soldiers and quite a bit of amazing pottery. They let me take photographs, which I appreciated. Terrific catalogs."
Flint_piggy,209,Dec 2016,December 2016,40,Free admission,"Had a pleasant surprise, when I went to the museum, for the month of December admission is free !! It is really a museum which gives you a small overview of some Asian cultures. Worth taking a look, you'll need about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, so it's not too wearing. Could do with some interactive exhibits."
StanleyFoo,713,Dec 2016,December 2016,40,Nice museum,"Nice musuem, very education with very good exhibits. Constantly constantly changing the exhibits thus you can visit this museum very often.."
Nigel G,"6,472",Dec 2016,December 2016,50,Impressive Museum ,"Visited this museum yesterday. It is especially worth while visiting in December as there is no entrance charge levied.<br/><br/>In addition to the permanent collection, there was one exhibition on Burma, and another on Maritime ports. <br/><br/>Starting on the ground floor, is a large collection of artefacts recovered from a vessel that sank of Java. It was discovered by fisherman in 1998. Much of the cargo is pottery, and while significant, is a little mundane to look at given the similarity of all the pieces. He just the end of the newly painted and that is obvious. There are more exciting works in the form of gold and silver, and the blue and white porcelain that has been recovered. It is thought that this was an Arab ship that was sailing from China to the Middle East. In the same room on the back wall are some very nice oil paintings of early Singapore and Macau and Guangzhou. <br/><br/>The trade routes are depicted in the next room and the opening of trade by sea in the Tang Dynasty. Many interesting artefacts on display. <br/><br/>There is a small display of Peranakan ceramics which are very colourful. A pair of gold bowls from around 830AD are probably the highlight of the display. Other works in silver are included.<br/><br/>The Burmese Exhibition has numerous works of art related to religion and culture. Divided by the Pegan and Rangoon eras. Nice pictures of the many pagodas.<br/><br/>Ports Exhibition is interesting and has many artefacts - my favourite being a diamond and gemstone Speer from India. Clothing, textiles and art are included. There is a section on Eurasian growth also.<br/><br/>A room is designated to Islamic art which is very interesting. <br/><br/>A nice museum to visit - about 3 to 4 hours is what it took me to go around - then a coffee stop before leaving.<br/><br/>If it's raining heavily getting to the entrance can be an issue. Nearest taxi drop off point is the Fullerton Hotel and a two minute walk across Cavanagh Bridge. At the of the bridge look right and you see the Dalhousie Obelisk and the steel balls - great for photography. Free wifi inside the museum. Short printed guides are available for each of the exhibitions as well as a handbook available at the museum shop.<br/><br/>A great afternoon!!!"
Paul A,453,Dec 2016,December 2016,40,Worth a visit,This is your chance to see and readup on asian history and see how it fits into this area. There is a lot to see and at the moment there is an expeition on a ship wreak and some of what it caotained.
SUSAN L,38,Dec 2016,December 2016,50,The place of history,"This is a place full of history. I am impressed by the guides who gave guided the tours of the sunkened china ceramics. Yes, surprised that I can even catch up on Chinese history into Singapore. There are also wide coverage of Singapore history and civilization around us. A recommended journey into the past ."
Capta1n57,332,Dec 2016,December 2016,50,Compulsory Visit.,"This is a lovely Museum. Even lovelier in December,when all exhibits were free!! Immaculately kept and alongside the river. It really is a nice place to see,and learn something along the way"
prufrock2,69,Dec 2016,January 2016,50,A Tour of Asian Multiculturality,"I have been three times to this Museum, while visiting my son who lives in Singapore, and spent a few hours there each time. I hope to go back one day. It has a wealth of well displayed items  converging as a powerful exhibition of the multicultural society that Singapore is. Size is not overwhelming, location is excellent and I can testify that temporary exhibitions of excellent quality are periodically waiting the visitors."
Slaw66,314,Dec 2016,December 2016,40,Worth a visit,We found the ancient exhibits from Myanmar very Interesting and enlightening. It's an eye-opener to a country rich in history and culture. The other Asian sections are just as intriguing. ACM is definitely worth a visit while in Singapore. Staff of ACM is friendly and helpful from the ticketing counter to the floors.
LolaGo1,"5,683",Dec 2016,December 2016,50,FREE entrance fee in December!,"I was looking for the Merlion Park when I came across this museum. Entrance is FREE in December when I visited it.<br/><br/>There are 3 floors of exhibits where ceramics, plates, vases were on display at the First Floor. These items are proofs that trades took place between Asian countries and those of Middle East.<br/><br/>The other floors have exhibits dealing with clothes, furnitures, etc. Special exhibits from Myanmar are also on display at this museum.<br/><br/>Tips: Visit other attractions near by such as the park, Singapore River and boat rides, Victoria Cultural Center, etc. Sit at one of the chairs located near the River. Rest and enjoy the views."
Singapore Views,"2,076",Dec 2016,December 2016,50,"Be Awed By Rare Objects of Exceptional Beauty, Magnificent Masterpieces of Talented &amp; Ingenious Craftsmanship","A visit is more meaningful when invested with an appreciation of Singapore's maritime heritage and purpose. Singapore lies between 2 oceans and is a key port in this network that rivaled the more famous Silk Route through Central Asia. Think movement of glass, wood, spices,cotton, silk, ceramics, precious stones/metals. In short, one should have an interest in the bazaar economy that defined Temasek. Do not expect artefacts from all Asian civilizations.<br/><br/>The displays are well lighted, properly presented in appropriate spaced zones. Airconditioned, serviced by lifts, clean exhibition halls, well appointed labels, attendants at hand to help and to guide. Exceptional.<br/><br/>My visit was on 2/Dec/2016... the day after Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi &amp; PM Lee Hsien Loong were guests-of-honor at the opening ceremony of a 3 month exhibition of Myanmar artefacts, ""Cities &amp; Kings: Ancient Treasures from Myanmar""<br/><br/>The Myanmar exhibits were arresting. As were all the other halls.. including the Tang Shipwreck section. Exquisite jewelry, interesting details, historical background - makes for a meaningful encounter."
John67-7,220,Dec 2016,December 2016,20,"Officious, small, expensive",The exhibits are good but very limited in range and curation. Security staff are officious and unwelcoming leaving a bad taste. There's much better Buddhist art at the tooth relic and that's also alive (a working monestary) and free to enter. We went on a Friday when admission is free. At a normal $23 this place is very poor value. Avoid.
IntoTheWorldUK,179,Nov 2016,November 2016,20,Too many pots!,"We were pretty disappointed with this museum. The title promises to inform you about the history of asian civilisation, however it focuses almost entirely on history of trade. I get that it's a huge part of the foundations of Asian economy; but it's far from all of it. There are a few spatterings of religious info, but the whole thing is disjointed and you really don't come away with a view of how Asia has evolved. There's too much use of historic names of places without describing the current names which makes it very confusing to know where they're talking about. <br/><br/>It's a lovely spacious building and it's all nicely presented. But the story, structure, breadth and information is completely lacking."
FussyNSW,122,Nov 2016,November 2016,50,Our Second Visit Here,"First time we went it was to get out of the heat, the second time was because we were so impressed with the exhibits on our first visit.

jaytara,558,Nov 2016,November 2016,30,Going downhill,"As a Singaporean, I have visited the ACM several times. I went with some foreign guests yesterday and found the place had gone downhill. Staff are indifferent and uninformed, the exhibits on Singapore have been removed, and there is a general air of malaise about the place. You are better off going to the Peranakan and/or National Museums. <br/><br/>Even the restrooms at ACM are not maintained well.<br/><br/>Given it preeminent location, urgent renewal is required to meet Singapore's high standards."
janmichael10,575,Nov 2016,November 2016,50,Just keeps on getting better. ,"The collections this time are better than the previous years. The interior is very rustic, a fusion of postmodern and colonial era feels. The rare collections have extended to include the remnants of Tang shipwreck, including among others porceilain, gadgets, and jewelries, of course, there are around 16,000 items found. It's a bit sad that southeast asian exhibit is closed at the moment, but the rest from clothing and textile, religions and faith, and other historical nexxus are still in tact. A must see to break the monotony in a food, adventure travel."
Fahmi T,51,Nov 2016,November 2016,50,Port Cities exhibition ,"There's an exhibition on now at Asian Civilisation Museum worth visiting. It shows the old trade routes in Asia &amp; the effects on the culture the trade has brought. Peranakan or Straits born Chinese is well reflected in the exquisite kebayas. The clothes on exhibit are a stand out as well as the jewellery on display. <br/>After the exhibit, make a bee line to the gift shop where a good selection of Singaporean gifts. <br/>Next stop is the National Art Museum"
Erica C,12,Nov 2016,December 2015,30,History place,"If you like to know more about Asian, Indochina is good to visit this museum for the history on how the civilisations go through in the past century. No suit for those who doesn't like history."
Marguerita T,238,Nov 2016,September 2016,50,Well Curated Museum showcasing Asian Historic n Cultural artefacts,"One of the best museums in Singapore, spacious and well lit offering comfortable room to examine artefacts from all over Asia.

The Tang Dynasty shipwreck at the basement is worth visiting!"
bigvicSydney,"3,665",Nov 2016,November 2016,50,Magnificent in every detail,To miss this Museum is a tragedy. We found this place by chance and there were very few visitors    What a shame.

SL9999,913,Oct 2016,October 2016,50,Small but beautiful,"Housed in a beautiful historic building, the museum has several galleries showcasing artifacts that help one understand different aspects of Asian history. Just as we purchased the tickets, a free tour was starting, and the docent (Mr. Xao if I have spelt it right) took us through a wonderful journey over the next hour, walking us through select galleries and explaining some of the artifacts with interesting historical information and humorous anecdotes. He was wonderful. If you can get a tour, take it, as the docents are knowledgable and eager to share that knowledge.<br/><br/>The wonderful collection of porcelain and ceramics from China and other parts of Asia is more than worth the nominal admission price for tourists (its free for residents and citizens). We also loved the ""Scholar in Chinese Culture"" gallery. The museum is not big so you can cover it fairly thoroughly in 3 - 4 hours.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for those interested in history or even those who just enjoy their museums."

We really enjoyed the Tang shipwreck and it's presentation. Definitely worth a visit, it would probably take 1 to 1.5 hours depending on your pace and interest level."
HarpistSantaFe,205,Oct 2016,October 2016,40,Good Seleciont - favors China and the Middle East,"Large collection of articles from Singapore, Malaysia, China and the Middle East.  Fewer items, and far less impressive collection from/ other Asian countries.  Excellent signage and descriptions"
HannahPtravel,292,Oct 2016,October 2016,40,Made me realise how little I know about the area,Lots of beautiful things on display from such a wide range of civilisations. And great air conditioning too.
Ani9701,329,Oct 2016,October 2016,50,Amazing collection of Asian Culture,"Beautiful colonial building and museum,<br/>The Tang shipwreck items, mostly porcelain (around year 800)  were amazing, also very nicely displayed.<br/>The adjacent cafe PRIVE was great."
jksCNX,67,Oct 2016,October 2016,30,Beautiful Colonial Building,"We highly recommend this museum if you are interested in ceramics and textiles.  We were a little disappointed because we had expected more of an ethnographic, archaeological,  and anthropological focus."
zuppiat,244,Oct 2016,September 2016,40,Very interesting,"With an entrance fee of around 8 dollar the museum is good value for money as you can spend a couple of hours here if you take your time. The museum is focused around Singapore, but has several Asian cultures showed as well. Especially the history on religion and the shipwreck was really interesting. I found there was a significantly high amount of ceramics showcased and the third hall with Chinese ceramics I had to skip. Overall recommended!"
the_nz_halls,119,Oct 2016,September 2016,40,Tang Shipwreck was the highlight,"Lovely building and museum, although a little confusing to find your way around.  The many items from the shipwreck of around the year 830 were incredible to see. The adjacent cafe that you could access from inside the museum but based outside by the river was lovely."
Marjie781,154,Oct 2016,September 2016,50,Showcasing beauty from the past,"Here is a wonderful collection of beautiful artworks that give an insight into the talents and abilities of people who lived in the area many, many years ago. It was exciting to be able to see and admire beautiful things created so long ago.<br/>The Tang Shipwreck - the innovative and artistic display of this was in a large, light-filled area, that gave full details of the recovery of the cargo from the wreck - and displayed it in such a wonderful way."
Amirah A,106,Sep 2016,March 2016,40,Great to know more about Singapore &amp; Asia,You will learn a lot of Singapore in terms of their cultural background as well as the rest of Asia in this museum. Best to visit during the weekdays.
SiamWanderer,"1,738",Sep 2016,August 2016,40,Cool,"Yes this is an air-con environment. On a hot sunny afternoon, this is the place to be. <br/>Full of history and knowledge, exhibits in this museum are all laid out in the spacious indoors. See, read, learn, and most important of all, enjoy the cool air within the walls of this iconic historical building.<br/>Bring your children, your friends and family. Make it a meaningful outing."
serina007,35,Sep 2016,August 2016,50,Worth Visiting,"Was there during the CHRISTIANITY IN ASIA and chance on a ""private tour"" and one conducted by the museum so though it was double dose, the personality of the guide and emphasis was different. Enjoyed both!"
Sozlovesholisays,"1,745",Sep 2016,September 2016,50,Excellant and free!!!,"We just wandered past this museum and decided to pop in, well worth the visit a lovely interesting place with a Restraunt/ bar on the fifth floor with lovely view across the Padang."
I K,128,Sep 2016,April 2016,50,an unexpected history tail about a harbour city,"we went just for ome 30 minutes visit and stayed about 2 hours. It is not big but extremely modern as a prsentation concept, each Hall presenting different part of the local heritage and culture. just in the city center, nearby their Parliament.Each hall starts with a screen from which an expert museologist decribe the heritage presented in the hall in simple and understandable English"
Nathan1000,903,Sep 2016,September 2016,40,Too much to see,"I believe a couple of hours is what you should allow for most museums or art galleries, even though many probably need 5+ hours.<br/><br/>Well, 2 hours was insufficient for ACM - so much history, so many rooms (some hard to access) and a great variety of exhibits. I particularly liked some of ceramics and the few limited paintings showing Singapore in its infancy.<br/><br/>I may need to visit again when next I visit Singapore."
Theju R,24,Sep 2016,January 2016,50,History of Singapore,Lots of information about history of SG &amp; helpful staff with detailed instructions.

lkkpaul,27,Sep 2016,September 2016,50,Fine collection of South East Asian civilisations artifacts.,"Well curated and displayed exhibits of artifacts from South East Asian civilisations. The permanent displays of Chinese porcelains and also artifacts from a sunken Tang era ship discovered in Indonesian waters, plus others are already worth the visit.

Yvette W,31,Sep 2016,May 2016,30,Enjoyable For History Buffs,"This museum gives nice insight to all the interesting artefacts found there. I find it convenient that they have themed displays, including ancient religions, Christianity and ceramics. The staff were very polite and the surroundings were very clean, so I that this museum is worth going to... if you like history. If you're a daredevil or an adrenaline seeker, this place is not for you. Otherwise, have fun!"
Tom W,139,Sep 2016,August 2016,30,museum worth a visit,This museum give a nice overview of the history of the area. The ship wreck found in Indonesian waters is interesting to see. It had a very diverse cargo.
David B,"9,986",Sep 2016,September 2016,50,Outstanding Tang Shipwreck Display,"The Asian Civilisations Museum features themed galleries, including Chinese ceramics, ancient religions, trade, and Christianity in Asia.<br/><br/>But my particular interest when I visited was the Tang Shipwreck display.<br/><br/>In 1998 a shipwreck was discovered off Belitung Island in the Java Sea.   It turned out to be a Tang Dynasty ship trading to the Middle East and contained more than 70,000 ceramics, plus gold and silver objects.<br/><br/>Many of the items were in a remarkable state of preservation and now form a breath-taking display in their own gallery at the Asian Cicilisations Museum.<br/><br/>For some reason when I fronted up to the ticketing counter I was told that admission today was free, so I did' argue and enjoyed my free visit."
GOKL P,117,Sep 2016,June 2016,50,Asian Civilisations Museum,"You know when some Mexican guy technically knocks out your national hero in 6 rounds and you end up slightly drunk and sad on a Sunday afternoon in Boat Quay, AND you know you have to sober up but you don't want to be lame by going home and passing out in your apartment? Well, sober up in class and among the general public by visiting the Asian Civilisations Museum!*<br/><br/>My husband decided to take me here, since it was a stone's throw away from the bar and so I could balance out my pathetic self with some culture. (He's so thoughtful, I know.)<br/><br/>Because this museum covers the history of a bunch of Asian countries, I found it to be a bit overwhelming. My favorite galleries were the Singapore River gallery and the Islamic gallery. I also liked a few of the interactive displays, specifically the people on those screens who could talk more in depth about certain themes or cultures.<br/><br/>History isn't really my thing, so I didn't enjoy this museum as much as the others. However, I do give it credit for having updated and modern-looking displays, and being well maintained overall. Maybe I should take a guided tour sometime to get more out of it.<br/><br/>P.S. They're really strict about umbrellas here, so strict that one of the guards told my husband that we couldn't enter an exhibit unless he put his umbrella away, even though it was dry. I simply stuffed it in my purse; I didn't want to argue with him because the last thing I need is to be in the headlines as ""Slightly drunk American girl threatens guard at SG's Asian Civilisations Museum over dry umbrella"".<br/><br/>*I do not recommend visiting museums if you've had too much to drink...<br/><br/>Museum exploring the history &amp; cultures of Asia &amp; their shaping of contemporary Singapore.<br/>Address: 1 Empress Pl, 179555<br/>Hours: 10AM–7PM<br/>Phone: 6332 7798"

Mohammed Homoud,141,Sep 2016,September 2016,30,Not what I expected ,Today admission was free or else I would have been a but unhappy to pay for this <br/>The artifacts where plentiful but the whole museum was small <br/>Nice idea to have an application for the museum but not simple to use <br/>I guess it's a once in a life kinda experience to have but not going there again
Nusi S,61,Sep 2016,May 2016,40,A glimpse into the past,Hubby and I did our own thing one day while in Singapore and I came here to the Ancient Civilisations Museum. I was here for hours then we went nearby to grab something tasty to eat :)
yakshaver,467,Sep 2016,August 2016,40,"Enjoyed the exhibitions, as well as the building","The main presentation when I visited, Christianity in Asia exhibition was well curated, as were the other sections."
Eleftherios K,93,Aug 2016,August 2016,50,Well worth a visit,"An extensive collection of important artifacts from various countries in the region spanning across centuries of Asian history. We were fortunate to follow a complimentary guided tour on symbolism. The Brazilian lady guide was informative and colourful taking us through the evolution of religion, ideas and culture. Highly recommended"
Warren H,"2,133",Aug 2016,November 2015,40,The best museum for history &amp; art of southeast asia,"This museum has been around for a long time.  Although not much improved, it remains the best museum about the history and art of not only Singapore but its neighbors.  Spacious and quiet, the venue affords you a stroll through the relatively short timeline of the country, the region and some interesting artifacts.  I have not seen any rivals in Southeast Asia so far ..."
LancsPozzie,34,Aug 2016,August 2016,40,Interesting,The shipwreck exhibition is fascinating and it is amazing that all these artefacts survived.<br/>The exhibitions are well set out and very open and airy.<br/>Staff are very helpful.
sweet_mermaid,243,Aug 2016,August 2016,30,Featured Exhibition : Christianity in Asia 27 May 2016 - 11 Sep 2016,"Visited this unique display of Christianity depicted in art forms across Asia. Very interesting as the local religions and cultures influenced the artists' depiction of Christianity. The exhibits take an hour to  1.5 hours to complete. Not a very huge exhibit. <br/><br/>TIPS: <br/>Note the free admission dates : 6 to 10 July, 6 to 10 August, 3 &amp; 4 September 2016<br/><br/>There's a free tour on weekdays at 1pm, check details with the ticket office. It is therefore best to visit the exhibition before the tour or after the tour. It is also best to lunch before the 1pm tour as it takes up about 1 hour. Very educational and insightful details on selective exhibits are being explained."
Jcook92,113,Aug 2016,July 2016,40,I loved it,"We easily took the MRT and arrived before the museum opened, and on a Saturday the area was quiet.  We walked around Clark Quay, walked on the pedestrian bridges, and went over to the Merlion.  Because of the close proximity we were able to do all of this before the museum opened and took some very nice photos because it was not busy.<br/><br/>The museum itself was large, open, and well air conditioned.  We followed the greeters directions and went up to the special exhibit on the top floor and worked our way down to the ground floor.  At the time we went the exhibit was Christianity in Asia.  This exhibit was vast and well done.  It not only talked about the missionaries and their role in Asia but also talked about the blends of eastern and western religions across the region.<br/>The regular exhibits were also interesting, especially the importance of colors of glaze and where the glaze kilns were located.<br/>Lastly, we saw the exhibit about the ship that sank with all the bowls.  It was very nicely done with the glass tubes and recovered bowls.<br/><br/>Plenty of nice bathrooms<br/>Extra cost for the special exhibits, but it's all very well done and worth it.<br/>not much to eat in the museum - head out to a hawker stall<br/>It wasn't busy - that's not to say it would be more busy in the afternoon - but arriving early made it easy to wander uninterrupted."
捷安 余,5,Aug 2016,August 2016,50,"Decent, Quiet, Simple and rich.","My friend and I went visit Asian Civilizations Museum for the ""Christianity in Asia"" exhibition.  The place s quiet, not very large but the space is good enough for its rich collection.  The decoration is simple but decent.  Worth a 1-2 hour visit.  It is often with special discount for the ticket in Friday evening."
PaulHedges,68,Aug 2016,February 2016,50,Wonderful Museum,"Coming from the UK I often find museums around the world a bit of a let down (after the British Museum, Ashmolean, V&amp;A, etc), however, while not on the same scale the ACM is a real treasure trove of local and regional artefacts and information. It often has special exhibits on and is certainly one of the things to do in Singapore."
esther1903,165,Aug 2016,August 2016,30,Not impressed with the customer service level,"When I arrived, I wanted to make an inquiry and I was rudely ""told"" by the guy at information to go over to ticketing side.  He didnt actually speak, but just pointed his finger. He's so rude that when I asked if there is a cafe there, he just said ""round the corner"".  I think the guy should not be a front line staff.  <br/>Then the guy old man at the ticketing counter was very pleasant and told us about the free visit because of National Day, and gave us the sticker and brochure for our visit."
Dan M,12,Aug 2016,August 2016,50,A top museum,This museum presents Asian treasures magnificently. One could easily spend hours in this building - there is so much to see and learn.
Greg H,47,Aug 2016,April 2016,50,Concise History of Asia in one spot,"We've twice had the opportunity to have a coupleof days in Singapore rather than the usual layover in Changi, so it's been great to get a feel for the city.<br/><br/>The Asian Civilisations Museum provides a great educational historical tour of Asia - you can learn a lot about the different Asian cultures in a very short period of time.<br/><br/>An added bonus is the Tang Shipwreck display, which showcases remarkable 7th-8th century ceramics, gold and silver objects which were being traded between China and Persia at a time when Europe was still recovering from the collapse of the Roman empire.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for anyone interested in art, history and Asia's place in the world."
NewYorkBliss,57,Aug 2016,August 2016,50,First rate museum.,"AT last a museum worth its name in Singapore. The permanent collections are very good, the temporary ones excellent. There is a whole floor for kids, and two absolutely amazing restaurants. It's my kids' favourite destination."
diannebateman770,43,Aug 2016,August 2016,50,Great Museum,"Went to this Museum 2 years ago.  Could have stayed all day. Unfortunately, didnt have time to go see the new displays this time.  You can buy a multi museum pass, which will get you into several museums.  DO IT!  The Peranakan Museam is well worth a vistit. While your at the Ancient Civillisation Museum, do yourself a favor and take a walk on the Cavanaugh Bridge, make sure you read the signs!  All along the waterfront there are bronze statues. Little boys jumping into the river, cats and kittens, traders etc.  Interesting.  Stop at Little Siagon on Clarke Quay and have some fried Tofu, GOD, what a treat. Get an ice cream sandwich from the little pedal cart along the key as well, thats exactly what you get. Icecream in a slice of bread.  Try the corn flavour.  Its great."
manique-fernando,80,Aug 2016,August 2016,40,Very informative and interesting!,Like the national museum this too has lots of history and stories behind each exhibit which was very nice. You can spend around 3 to 4 hours inside. I personally found 2000 years of Christianity in Asia very interesting.
vlen135,49,Aug 2016,August 2016,40,Interesting place to cool off during hot Singaporean day,You can compare what Asia could suggest culturally when Europe was climbing out Dark Ages. Good learning experience. There was also exhibition of Christianity in South East Asia during our visit. Also interesting.
HannahQian,7,Aug 2016,May 2016,50,Excellent,"It is very modern, with wonderful exhibitions from famous artiest. The architecture itself is really stylish"
roadtrippernineteen,256,Aug 2016,August 2016,50,Good way to spend time with Family,"Went with my aunts and they found out things they didn't know about Asia and Singapore. If you are Singaporean and over 60, it's free! The main area is free for Singaporeans. What a great way to slow Singaporeans to learn about their history."
arunkumar d,101,Aug 2016,October 2015,30,one of the best museum in singapore,"one of the best museum in singapore. It is best for people like history , monuments. If you here for long time then it is worth a visit."
Piggy M,92,Aug 2016,July 2016,30,A small museum with nice view and music,"The museum is located along Singapore River, near Boat Quay. It is in a small old British style building.  It exhibits Asians artifacts, like the ones from Tang shipwreck.  Currently, it is showing Christianity in Asian.  <br/><br/>During my visit, there was a female tour guide, dressed up as different characters and explained the artifacts in her ""acting role"" to the kids.  that made the mini tour not only educational but also interesting. <br/><br/>There were music bands playing on the grass in front of the museum in late afternoon.  I assume it's kind of programs offer by museum. It's a great way to spend a relaxing afternoon (around 2 hrs)"
Toby Cheong,373,Aug 2016,October 2015,20,too boring,some of the facts are fake and made up. waste of time and $$$ going there.. would rather go other places with great good.
johnnySingapore,52,Aug 2016,August 2016,40,Tang shipwreck gallery,Full of tang treasure in this gallery . If you interested in Chinese history this is the place for you.see it n you believe it
Ken W,8,Aug 2016,February 2016,40,Asian Civilisation Museum,"One of Singapore museum, it specialized in showcasing some of the rare artifacts from the Asean region. 2-3 hours tour will be required for a good visit. Easily accessible via Raffles Place MRT station"
warfield-uk,27,Aug 2016,July 2016,50,Everything I didn't know about Asian Civilisations,I really did not understand the how Asian civilisations were organized or their origins. This is an extremely interesting museum that helps one understand how the numerous peoples across Asia relate and how the cultures have affected us in the west as well as Singapore.
Umar H,6,Aug 2016,July 2016,50,Awesome museum!,If you are a history buff this is a must visit. It has a vast collection of artefacts from all over Asia and offers great insights into Asian history
SC-TADoc,213,Aug 2016,April 2016,40,A little disjointed,"Colourful exhibits that feature life in Singapore/Malaysia in the past few centuries, including ceramics, furniture, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed the Tang Shipwreck exhibit. Great rainy day option. Definitely for history buffs."
westbergholt,10,Aug 2016,July 2016,50,Regional development Information,"An excellent museum full of interesting facts and exhibits. We took part in an accompanied guide walkthrough, and then returned to the various areas in our own time to see those items that we really were interested in"
robbielampard,88,Aug 2016,July 2016,40,impressive,"impressive museum and needs a few hours of getting done, typically is as the name suggests, best day time"
cricketguru,197,Aug 2016,August 2016,30,OK but a bit staid,This museum has a great riverside setting in the heart of Singapore and it's interesting but not awe inspiring. If you're really interested in Asian history and the development of religions in the region then fine but it really felt a bit dry and once you've seen one bit of stone carving from a Hindu temple you perhaps feel you've seem them all. I would have liked a bit more of the recent history of Singapore but I guess that's not what this museum is for.
Laetitia M,18,Aug 2016,September 2015,30,average,"It's hard to know which way to go to follow a historical order. To much to read. Sometimes, lighting is wrongly oriented meaning, you're in front of the explanation, but you're hiding the light at the same time. I much prefer the National Museum."
Chiefmadapple,11,Aug 2016,June 2016,40,"Excellent Collection, Not Friendly Staff","They like to shush you into quiet submission at this place despite the fact that there are really not many people inside and your volume only sounds loud because of that.  The collection is really good though and well worth the admission ticket, especially after renovations."
cassiesim,56,Jul 2016,July 2016,40,Very informative,"Been there twice in my life, both times enriching and educational. The place was well maintained, and I learnt heaps!"
empty nester flying her nest,235,Jul 2016,May 2016,40,A good overview of the history of the region,"If you want to find out about the history of more than just Singapore (in which case go to the National Museum), the ACM gives a good overview of the history of a number of Asian countries across thousands of years.  At times this can make it a bit too much to take in, but some very good exhibitions none-the-less.  Also look out for the excellent Friends of the Museum (FOM) talks here too - weekly on a Monday morning and monthly on a Friday evening - on a range of Asian/historical topics."
JulieLimSY,157,Jul 2016,July 2016,30,Average,"I found this museum to be somewhat haphazard.  There are not enough clear signages to tell you where the exhibits are.  <br/><br/>There was also a special exhibition on Christianity on the second floor but because I did not pay to see that special exhibition, I had to go back to the first floor, walk round to the other side of the museum and get back up to the second floor in order to by pass the special exhibition to see an exhibit that was located beyond that.<br/><br/>Ok to visit only if you have time to kill."
M V,228,Jul 2016,July 2016,40,Intesting little museum,Nice museum with a relatively large exhibition by Singapore standards of various cultural objects.  While it may not be very big the exhibits are very high quality and interesting.  I would recommend this museum over any other in Singapore for those looking for some culture or a nice few hours indoors.  There is a nice cafe in the lobby that we enjoyed as well at the conclusion of our tour.
ABCDWhite,27,Jul 2016,May 2016,40,A beautiful Museum,This place is stunning.  It is so well curated and well taken care of. The new wing is so funky.  The content is so interesting and the location cant be beaten. One of the many fantastic museums in Singapore but one with relevant content that walks you through the history of the region.
Jenny W,78,Jul 2016,July 2016,50,Really interesting,"We were killing time in Singapore prior to flying home and an English couple where we had lunch suggested this museum. It really is worth visiting, they have a permanent exhibition of 9th century porcelain salvaged from a boat that sank around that time, beautifully displayed, you'll constantly have to convince yourself that it's really that old and been under the sea for that long. We also saw some other stunning antiques including Chinese furniture, more porcelain and sculpture. The meseum is just the right size to get round easily if you've two or three hours to spare."
ini_niki,66,Jul 2016,May 2016,50,One of the best museums in Asia,"This is my favourite place to visit and take visitors to in Singapore. The historical building, the well curated exhibits, the nice places to eat and take photos, the excellent overview of not only Singapore's history and culture but also the surrounding region, all make this one of the best museums I've ever visited. I actually go visit it whenever I feel the need for a bit of reflection. This is a particularly good spot if you're only in Singapore and southeast Asia for a short time as you will get a great overview of the entire region - all in air-conditioned comfort too. You do have to pay to enter, but the price is well worth it. You can get to the museum via taxi or take the MRT (subway) and walk over an historic bridge :) ... Can you tell how much I love this place? LOL :)"
Jimclevs,71,Jul 2016,July 2016,50,A real find,"The ACM is situated in one of the old colonial buildings right on the waterfront near the bridge over to the Fullerton Hotel.  Some of the permanent artworks are priceless and all of it is fascinating,  There is also currently a major additional exhibition showing some of the pottery and gold and silver artefacts discovered in a shipwreck of an Arabian dhow  circa 830 (?) whilst on its return from China to the Middle East."
WorldProf,116,Jul 2016,July 2016,50,A real find for those interested in history and art,"This highly recommended museum is located in an historic colonial era building. Nicely remodeled. The exhibition of the 9th century shipwreck findings is outstanding and creatively displayed. Excellent collections of porcelain, china, furniture, etc. A special exhibition of Religion and Christianity in Asia was one of the best of its kind I have ever visited with original documents and items on loan from around the world. Non-flash photography allowed. Bonus: There is an excellent Chinese restaurant on the premises with riverfront view."
Shella H,24,Jul 2016,July 2016,40,"Good museum, better visited without young children",This was a good museum with interesting exhibits and well put together information. We had several young children in tow and while there was a children's area it was closed at the time we visited.

Items have been displayed very imaginatively with excellent lighting and information placards..<br/>There are plenty of displays , participating games where children can participate . <br/>Great place to vosit for people of all ages <br/>A must see for you and the kids when in Singapore."
ochassot,967,Jul 2016,July 2016,30,Good for a quick visit on a rainy day,I expected much more from the Asian Civilisations Museum. The rooms display little artefacts and there are changing exhibits. A good option for a rainy day.
TravellingFalco,54,Jul 2016,July 2016,50,Beautiful and interesting,Have been to the museum 3 times now and enjoyed it every time.<br/><br/>Renovations and extensions have been recently completed and the space ahs been used really well with new interesting galleries. A great place for anyone interested in Asian culture and the way east and west have interacted over time. <br/><br/>Great place to spend a few hours and always something new to see.
pinaynomad7,116,Jul 2016,November 2015,40,interactive,This museum is great for tourist so they would learn Asian history. The museum is well maintained and the staff are real friendly.

Fiona T,45,Jul 2016,June 2016,30,A rich history,"Good place to visit for a brief escape from the heat/humidity. There is a small charge. Some great exhibits which do give you an idea of the interesting history of Asian civilisations. Not really my thing, but my partner loved it. Not an all day museum trip. We spent about an hour hear looking around."

As the displays from this shipwreck were for commercial trade, the decoration was not as exquisite compared with those meant for the court.  <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the skill level was extremely high to make a well form object without defect in shape formation.<br/><br/>There are other displays of Asian Civilization, pay particular attention to a blue color exhibit on the second level.  Extreme display of firing skill and know how just by looking at the distribution of the blue color glaze."
lchan289,"1,582",Jul 2016,June 2016,40,Lovely bite sized museum,"I visited for the second time; in particular to see the Chinese ceramics exhibition on the third floor.<br/><br/>This isn't a large museum and can be done probably at a leisurely pace in an hour and a half.  Or if you work at nearby Raffles Place, you can probably complete your visit over two lunch time sessions. <br/><br/>The building has been beautifully restored and the galleries are nicely lit and spacious.  On both my visits the museum wasn't very busy and you may find your alone in some of the gallery rooms. Better for a slow appreciation of the exhibits.<br/><br/>The highlights for me were the Tang shipwreck and the trade route galleries (in particular, the elaborately crafted Indian cabinets). There is also a a small low lit room on the ground floor dedicated to Chinese ceramics -it contains a delightful statue of a Chinese lady that is actually a water pitcher 😀 <br/><br/>The slightly larger Chinese ceramic collection on the third floor was pretty good too.  The route to the third floor gallery does need to be better sign posted though. <br/><br/>A word on the museum cafe - the food needs much improvement. You are better off heading to the nearby Fullerton hotel cafe or the numerous cafe options at Raffles Place for a meal. The Empress Chinese restaurant on the grounds does looks impressive and might be worth checking out if you have a more upscale meal in mind."
Ed N,41,Jun 2016,June 2016,50,Nice sized with interesting displays . . .,"Nicely displayed artifacts.  Do not miss the shipwreck . . . pretty amazing preserved items.  Good blend of items should appeal to a variety of interests.  The special religions display was a bonus.  Also, we lucked out in that the bulk of the rain for the day came when we were inside; take advantage if outside touring is limited, especially."
aliceyes,57,Jun 2016,May 2016,50,Beautiful!,"Had a wonderful few hours walking around the exhibits! They have such a large range of pieces, many different cultures, and materials! The guided tours are also great, they really set the scene, and the guides have so much extra knowledge and so much enthusiasm!"
Sherry Y,56,Jun 2016,June 2016,40,Small museum with limited collection but experience made so much better and interesting by the tour guides at the Museum,"Recently went there to see the new exhibit on Christianity in Asia.  After inquiry, was told there was a guided tour on their permanent exhibit, so we joined.  Fortunately or unfortunately there were just me and my husband with the 2 young lady guides.  Think these tours may not be well advertised.  They gave us a 50 min tour on religion in Asia and show the artifact related to this in the museum.  They were very knowledgeable and answer many of our questions.<br/>Since we enjoyed this so much, we saw another tour guide in the section on Tang Shipwreck so joined that as well.  This particular tour guide was very funny and  engaging.  Would recommend joining these free guided tours if possible.  Makes the experience so much more interesting and educational."
Masayoshi,"3,963",Jun 2016,June 2016,50,My favourite place in Singapore ,"I know this is a small museum.<br/>I know not many people agree with me.<br/>But, this is my favourite place in Singapore.<br/><br/>I love the small sculptures from Gandhara a lot.<br/>I love the detailed explanations on items from many areas in Asia.<br/><br/>Also, this is a nice place to escape from the heat of Singapore. hahaha"
dokness,207,Jun 2016,June 2016,30,Little to see,"The ground floor is mainly Chinese pottery. I personally didn't find it very appealing. The second floor exhibit of Asian religious art (sculpture, mainly) was nice and interesting, albeit not very large, and had good descriptive signposting. We didn't have the extra tickets to the Christianity exhibit, so we didn't see that. The downstairs restaurant was spectacular though."
Wai Meng Y,272,Jun 2016,June 2016,40,Informative and engaging,"We spent an evening in ACM on Sunday viewing both the permanent exhibits and the new exhibit on Christianity in Asia. Very informative and engaging. The museum uses VR for its permanent exhibit on tang shipwrecks, which you either use the smartphone attached to view, or download the ACM VR app and attach to the available VR gear to watch. That engages the kids a fair bit.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the ACM app allows you to have personalised tour of the museum as you walk around. So it's not just reading the descriptions or looking at the exhibits alone.<br/><br/>The Christianity in Asia exhibition is wonderful. If you are a Christiab from a mainstream denomination, you will recognise many symbols and traditions put on display. If you are familiar with Asian cultures, you will also be familiar with some of the cultures depicted in these artefacts.<br/><br/>The museum is spacious and clean. Very good to spend a day there. Free for Singaporeans, except for the Christianity in Asia exhibition, which is $9 per adult (Singaporean)."
Lovesoul,105,Jun 2016,May 2016,40,"A little bit disappointed, but loved the top floor","I was a little disappointed in this museum, but that's because I had an outdated guidebook.  I had a guidebook from my first visit to Singapore about 4 years ago.  So I looked up this museum, and was excited about the exhibits.<br/><br/>Then, I got there, and most of the exhibits I wanted to see weren't there any more.  They'd changed them.  I totally understand that, but what's there now wasn't really what I came to see.<br/><br/>I loved the top floor, though.  Lots of Buddhas and other relics that are incredibly beautiful.  It was worth the trip just for this.<br/><br/>It was an easy walk from the MRT, and is a beautiful building.  Because I'm over 60, I even got a discount.<br/><br/>My advice?  Call the museum and make sure the current exhibits interest you before you go."
ukare4me,127,Jun 2016,November 2015,30,Avg,It is open House on National Holidays and best time to go. Does not have much of a collection but you cant blame them Singapore is a tiny city / country.
florida_filly_61,27,Jun 2016,May 2016,40,Interesting exhibits,"This beautiful Colonial building is located in the Civic District right on Singapore river.  Senior admission was courteously offered to us.  We wondered around the exibits at our leisure and were invited to join a guided tour.  The Tang Shipwreck exhibit was uncluttered and clearly signed in English.  The ceramics recovered were very interesting and showed the trade between China and the Islamic world.  There were some beautiful porcelain items on display.  A calm, spacious, air conditioned exhibition space to wonder around."
Emperor P,6,Jun 2016,March 2016,40,Lots of interesting stuff to see!,There were many ancient artefacts of the different ancient civilisations! It introduced a lot of new history to me! Amazing! This place is a place of history!
Tonya H,24,Jun 2016,May 2016,50,A Great History Lesson,I love history and this did not disappoint. This had so many interesting artifacts I wish I could have had more time there.
CEH,207,Jun 2016,June 2016,40,Interesting historical scene,Most of the museum is free to go round and offers lots of historical information.  The exhibition is over 3 floors
TravellingBee338,174,Jun 2016,May 2016,20,Disappointed,This museum simply didn't seem ready for visitors.  At least half of the museum was empty and the parts that weren't empty had inadequate information about the exhibits. I was very disappointed.
Billy Z,"6,036",Jun 2016,June 2016,40,Take your time to enjoy it,"As with any museum it takes time to go through the exhibits in order to fully understand and appreciate the stories behind them, much of which depends on the narratives as a whole. In the latest exhbition on Christianity in Asia, which showcases the influence of Asian arts and cultures on sacred images and articles, the museum has put together an interesting flow of the ideas behind the artistic creation of the materials in the context of its time. One doesn't need to be a believer to enjoy the religious art pieces as evident by the fact that many of these Christian arts were produced for the non-Christian rulers in Asia.<br/><br/>The Tang Shipwreck exhibits also presented an interesting range of ceramic wares that traced back the sea trades between China and the Islamic world, through the inclusion of inscription and designs representative of the reigns of the cargoes destined for.<br/><br/>Take your time and immerse yourself in the exhibits, don't rush!"
Saumya A,21,May 2016,April 2016,30,Boring but informative,It has collection of ancient civilizations. I particularly liked Indian one but overall it is dull and boring.
Groundnuts,424,May 2016,May 2016,40,Nice place,"Dropped by as I was nearby, but we end up spending 2 over hours. There's still few exhibits that's work in progress. Particularly interested in the Tang Shipwreck collection and trade zone where we can see China as a contract manufacturer in the early centuries. Porcelain were made and painted based on western and Arabian specifications. I recommend to take the guided tour. Beautiful place &amp; layout and lastly a  very nice cafe that had outdoor dining by the river."
Jon,78,May 2016,May 2016,40,Fascinating history especially the sunken ship,"A great bit of history about Asian Civilisation and trade with the middle East. While still under renovation, the main attraction being the sunken ship with its cargo made the visit well worthwhile. You need about 2 hours in the museum in its current state. I went on a day when admission was free and also joined the free guided tour which is a must to appreciate the history."
vicpk,442,May 2016,May 2016,40,Important history to view,"A wonderful museum situated in an old government building, it covers the rich history of Singapore, with special exhibitions"
oo-foodielicious,681,May 2016,May 2016,40,Treasures in the musuem,"This was my second visit since the first many years ago. The museum was spick and span with brightly lit areas and beautiful ornaments, bowls and structure etc, some displayed behind glasses while some kept within boundaries. I had a quick tour of the Treasures of the Past, and it was a pleasant journey through the 'treasures'. Only issue was that there could be better signage path indicating the best order in viewing the artefacts."
Ashwathram,"1,975",May 2016,July 2015,40,Finest Exhibits of Treasures of The Past,"ACM is a finest museum, exhibiting treasures from Kolkata Museum, statues , idols arts and articrafs ,ornaments, idols from India and from other Asian nations, The museum is very close to Clarke's Quay...The Buddha  exhibits in the  galleries are superb and its really informative.. taking us to reflect upon the glorious  past history and civilization of Asia....I took 2 hours to explore around the galleries .Victoria Memorial, House of Old Parliament ,SG High Court,SG Parliament House are some of the close by attractions."
TeyHoney,158,May 2016,June 2015,50,Amazing!,"I am a fan of museums and arts. I visited Asian Civilisation Museum in Singapore way back August 2012 and it is a very nice museum. They have shown the arts, clothing, culture and history of other Asian countries. You will not be bored even you are alone because you have a lot to see and discover inside this building."
Fiona D,94,May 2016,May 2016,50,Well worth a visit,This museum is laid out wonderfully. Had an hour after a business meeting for a quick browse and it wasn't too overwhelming. The artifacts are very simply presented - letting them tell their own story. I particularly liked the ceramics collection from the Tang shipwreck - fascinating to see how well preserved they were and how trade flourished between east and west. Returned for dinner at the adjacent restaurant - delicious!
Sema_KM,19,May 2016,March 2016,30,A small but tidy place,Kind of museum that you should visit if you have lots of free time in Singapore. It is a small museum. Has a nice and well kept collection but not there is not much to see.
thoughtfulpebble,737,May 2016,December 2015,50,"Great for culture vultures, can be boring for children","A very wide variety of interesting exhibits. If you can, attend a tour with one of the docents, who are all extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the museum. The only downside is that children may be bored, because the exhibits are not interactive, and they will be ""hush""-ed if they talk too loudly. But still worth 5 stars."
Jeffry b,"5,199",May 2016,May 2016,50,on show,"This is a marvellous museum. When the Singaporeans set out to do something, they do it very well. Asia has a very rich history and has been the cradle of many civilisations and beliefs. I am something of an aficionado of Asian cultures and religions, so I found this Museum fascinating. I will definitely visit again when I am in Singapore next."
love2trave09,184,May 2016,May 2016,50,A sometimes overlooked gem,"Interesting collection of religious and artistic items from all over the Middle and Near East countries and cultures. The museum is still a work in progress, so some of the galleries are better organized than others.  One of the most impressive areas is the contents of a ship wreck, brought to the museum within the last 20 years. Singapore was part of the sea-trade route, so it saw travelers from all over who brought interesting goods and products for the locals to buy."
Rsars,355,May 2016,April 2016,50,beautiful,"This is a beautiful building with a good collection of Asian Art. We found it a pity that so many of the exhibition rooms were closed on the day we went, though."
martyna_polska,190,May 2016,February 2016,50,Check the trip with the free tour guide - amazing!,"We went there on rainy Friday and took part in a one hour free guided tour (on Fridays at 7 pm) - we were so lucky as the guide was really into culture, with passion and a nice way of telling the stories! The museum itself is cool, the digital features are great if you want to listen to some pieces of history. Just take something to cover your arms as the aircon is crazy here!"
joyceheard,338,May 2016,May 2016,30,Will soon be fabulous,"The best exhibit is the shipwreck collection, items form 600 t0 800 AD from a shipwreck of the coast of Singapore. Chinese made trade goods including rare gold plates and the largest ever found solid gold wine cup of the era. A new augmented reality AP lets you see the ship as it was in 3D. As the museum is nearly finished with a major renovation, some of the rooms are still empty and other exhibits are missing information. Will soon be wonderful."
afk,32,Apr 2016,March 2016,50,"Well organized, paired with ACM app","Attractive displays of artifacts in a beautiful building, well organized and with clear descriptions."
AussiesX5,55,Apr 2016,April 2016,40,Fascinating Tang shipwreck display.,This museum is well worth visiting for the fascinating Tang Era shipwreck display alone. We spent an hour looking at the pottery and artefacts recovered from this trading ship that sank off Surabaya 1400 yrs ago...and then went on a free guided tour. It was highly enjoyable.<br/>The museum is undergoing renovations and other displays not up to the same standard.
Bill N,323,Apr 2016,April 2016,50,Well presented,"Provides overview of history of Singapore. Historical building, well maintained and presented. Some exhibits being updated at this time. Allow minimum 2 hours. Can be rainy day activity!! Nice cafe with good service."
Lisa H,13,Apr 2016,April 2016,50,historic Museum,"If you want to learn about the history of Singapore , that's the place to go, a lot of objects , very good presentation"
Waritorn J,100,Apr 2016,April 2016,40,Nice musuem with good architecture.,I like to see European and great architecture. This musuem is located near by Marina bay. I just walk under the bridge and reach to here. Inside is also a great interesting for studying some differents and show the Asian history information of each country.
Gopinath Prabhu,"2,548",Apr 2016,August 2015,50,Nice museum,"We visited during Singapore's Golden Jubilee celebrations, so the entry was free.<br/><br/>A well maintained museum with lots of artefacts. Its along the Singapore River and can be clubbed while visiting Boat Quay."
Jeannie M,33,Apr 2016,April 2016,10,Not up to scratch,Couldn't compare to the numerous museums throughout SE Asia. Mainly pictures and pottery. Very disappointing.
sriram2016,69,Apr 2016,October 2015,50,must see place,this museum is not free we have to get a ticket which is 2 to5 sgd that is 300 rs max.this shows everything even the 452 carat ruby of Jahangir and the glass swords of china it shows the medieval world and the rise of Asian civilisations
Devonfish,182,Apr 2016,April 2016,50,Go find the boat treasures,"This is a first class museum, but its highlight is the mainly ceramic treasures found from a boat that sunk in 830."
Europelover2014,"2,095",Apr 2016,April 2016,30,Few exhibits open,"I am very glad we arrived on a Sunday with free admittance.  I'd been looking forward to this museum as it was totally closed on our last year's visit.  It was disappointing to see only a few major exhibit rooms open.  The Tang Shipwreck was interesting - especially if you have any archeology background.  The other exhibits were limited - I enjoy Buddhist and Hindu art, but the Religion exhibit here was very sparse and informational notes very basic.  Likewise with Highlights from the Collection - items out of context , I prefer an exhibit that tells a story, traces a timeline, relates items to the culture, etc, not just shows the artifacts, no matter how unique.  The Southeast Asia exhibit, which is my real interest. had just closed for renovation.  Sad, but a reason to return."
owltravel2015,239,Apr 2016,March 2016,40,Rare culture spot in Singapore,"This museum is rich in various exhibitions from different time and Asian countries. If you are tired of artificial amusement in Singapore, this is a good place for getting some relief and silence."
Borja T,70,Apr 2016,March 2016,50,Very interesting museum,"Visit the Tang shipwreck, and if you are lucky (as I was) you will get a free guided tour that will give you an excellent insight over the asian culture in general"
Boabin,76,Apr 2016,March 2016,40,Interesting,Great place to learn a little history. You won't be swamped with a lot of artifacts or items here. For the price I expected more but it was still interesting.
SusanSSS,246,Apr 2016,October 2015,50,Outstanding museum,"In my opinion, one of the premier museums in the world. Covers countries in all of Asia, not just Singapore.  Great value for your money."
Live_to_Travel_125,81,Apr 2016,March 2016,30,Interesting Place to Visit,We arrived early in the morning to take a look around.  It was rather interesting though some sections were closed for renovations (hence the average rating).  It didn't take long to see it all.
ceelow75,15,Mar 2016,March 2016,30,Not what I was expecting,I've heard a lot about this place through all the reviews but when I went it wasn't what I was expecting. I guess its because I went on a day that they were changing the exhibits. I usually complete museums in 2 hours. I was done in 30 minutes.
jfdjr,193,Mar 2016,March 2016,50,Wonderful Museum,"I thought I'd spend maybe 2 hours here -- I bet I spent that just at the special exhibit of the Tang Dynasty era shipwreck.  While everything is not 'Singaporean', it does cover displays covering all of the different cultures that have an effect on Singapore.  My only complaint is that other than the Tang exhibit, the rest of the place could have been lit just slightly more."
DanieljLea,47,Mar 2016,March 2016,10,Visitors should be warned,"Although a large signage says welcome to our new spaces, visitors are not informed 90%of the museum is under renovation or more profusely, re Organization"
Nabeel K,4,Mar 2016,April 2015,50,"History, plus technology","It was my first time I was greeted at any place by a kiosk, and while the screens were zonky sometimes, I found the structure, layout, content and overall mood so overwhelming that I dreamt of taking my kids there one day. Well-done."
Rikuziyi,23,Mar 2016,March 2016,20,Meh...,Not even close to the best museum ever been to. Most the exhibits were closed and found it really difficult no navigate my way round.<br/>Some of the artefacts were interesting I guess but not presented in a useful or imaginative way unlike the nearby National Museum of Singapore
beuleu,117,Mar 2016,March 2016,50,"Museum presenting interesting historical aspects of SE asia, can be covered in 1-2 h.","It is a small museum but in a beautiful building. Some pieces are astonishing by their size and beautifully displayed.<br/>Explanations for pieces are a bit too short.<br/>Museum shop at entrance is proposing gifts that are for sure more ""local"" than what can be found in chinatown or little india."
E5645LDjohnb,61,Mar 2016,March 2016,40,Some rare and unusual exhibits,Worth stopping by this museum if only to shelter in the air conditioning for a n hour. The ship wreck room is amazing - so many near priceless treasures on display.
Stubbs1956,53,Mar 2016,January 2016,50,Fascinating history lesson for me. Exhibits are first class.,To understand Singapore and its culture you must start here. From the landing of Sir Stamford Raffles and WW2 thru to Independence this is very educational for all.
Sandra R,120,Mar 2016,March 2016,40,fascinating insights,Recommend a visit to learn much about Asia and its history. We self-guided and had no trouble finding our way around. A fascinating and eclectic collection.

adbost,208,Mar 2016,February 2016,50,"Great museum, interesting collection","The museum has a vast collection, although part of it was under renovation (February 2016). It is accessible, very near the MRT station and other attractions are nearby. The entrance fee for tourists is S$8. Be sure to come early on Mondays to Thursdays because the last guided tour is at 2pm."
adrian_picard,8,Mar 2016,February 2016,50,Excellent exhibition,"This museum shows artifacts of the different cultures in Southeast Asia which was interesting. During our visit there were children with their teacher and we were impressed with the way they were kept busy: solving puzzles, locating certain articles, very interactive!<br/>The highlight of the museum was the special exhibition about the ninth century wooden boat that was excavated off the coast of Indonesia and the hundreds of artifacts found in it that are now on display. Very interesting to see where some of the pottery originated and how one can trace the trade routes of that era."
RichardinSG,164,Mar 2016,June 2015,40,A great reminder of our mortality,"I love this Museum,  they have laid it out with some wonderful collections and the trip through the many manifestations of the Buddhu is eye opening.   If you're in town - pay it a visit."
Keith-Clan,70,Mar 2016,March 2016,50,Awesome exhibition of 9th Century Tang Dynasty shipwreck,Well worth planning your trip to coincide with the guided tour. The museum overall has some very interesting exhibits. There is a very reasonably priced comprehensive book summarising the Tang exhibition.
AustralianTravel,91,Mar 2016,April 2015,40,"Interesting visit, good to learn about the history of singapore",From fishing village to fortress to dynamic mid level economy in a very short time frame.  This is a very comprehensive and engaging museum.
mickey448,139,Mar 2016,February 2016,50,Great museum - don't miss it,Spent an entire day at this museum and loved every aspect of it. Include it in your holiday plans. Worth the trip
Brazingo,149,Mar 2016,February 2016,30,Great Museum with potential - worth it but not all there yet,"This museum features the Asian artifacts from a Shipwreck It also has many old artifacts from the early dynasties. Everything is well presented with an app to listen to recordings in different parts of the museum. There were many areas closed off or under renovation. For 8 Singapore Dollars, it is worth an hour or so. Will be much better when finished."
H L,188,Mar 2016,March 2016,50,A NICE SURPRISE IN THE CIVIC DISTRICT,"I was brought here by a local friend living in Singapore and what a nice surprise it was.<br/>The Museum is only on two floors very easy to get around, with the main attraction on the ground floor - the Tang Shipwreck and second floor focusing on South East Asians heritage and cultural artefacts.  <br/>We had some refreshments at Prive, the cafe/restaurant before leaving.  Very nice deco with local theme and food. I had the local tea.<br/>Definitely worth a visit if you are in the civic district in Singapore, escape the heat and a great way to understanding of the history of S. E. Asia!"
beaulieuhouse,12,Mar 2016,February 2016,50,Interesting cultural Museum,I happened to get there doing Chinese new year and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the exhibitions in addition they had a wonderful little museum restaurant that had great food.

Y0rkshire_Travellers,103,Mar 2016,February 2016,40,Something a bit different,We had some time before we boarded our cruise ship so thought we would spend some time in this recommended museum. Plus it was mostly air conditioned. They had a good range of pieces and everything was written in English. My 10 year enjoyed her time there as well so something all the family can do. Stop at the restaurant for a nice cake and a coffee. I would spend an hour or two looking around if you want to get out of the heat for awhile.
sunnysandiegodays,40,Mar 2016,February 2016,40,Really enjoyed this museum,"Great explanations, well written.  Appreciate the artifacts from all over Asia. Enjoyed all the textiles especially."

Jordan B,35,Mar 2016,July 2015,40,Awesome place to find events,"There are often cool events here, like during Halloween and other holidays, and it has great A.C. and a location right next to a cool live music joint, the Timbre."
JulieHelene,188,Mar 2016,February 2016,30,Civilisation museum,"Feb / 2016 there was only few collections available at the moment. The renovation took really much space away from the show rooms, and for exsample the islam-collection was located in a really small area. The shipwrek- collection was ok. <br/><br/>I still think the museum is worth of visiting if you are in Singapore."
diasjulius1234,257,Feb 2016,March 2015,50,MUSEUM,Museum situated right in the heart of singapore river... It depicts rich cultural asian civilization...
Donna N,71,Feb 2016,February 2016,50,Excellent,"This is the best museum in Singapore. Every time I go they have an excellent special exhibit besides their pernnament collection.  If you are interested in Southeast Asian history and the art they created this is a must see. Their displays   are extremely well presented.  Their collections are extensive and show the best of the different cultures. <br/>Their present special exhibit is the Tang Shipwreck from 830 AD.  It is beautifully displayed in their newly opened gallery.  It is very informative,  showing ceramics, gold and silver relics from the famous kilns of China. <br/>The museum is located on the Singapore River  in the beautiful downtown area of the city.  The colonial building is a beauty in itself.  There is a cafe where you can get a good meal and picturesque views of the river and the skyline. <br/>It is a must if you are interested in history, art, cultures of Asia and a true Singapore experience. <br/>Only con is a disappointing museum shop.  Their old shop was magnificent , this one is a very poor replacement."
WriterKathy,26,Feb 2016,January 2016,50,Excellent docent tour.  Marvelous pieces to see.  Impressive building and collections,Fascinating and well ordered.  A must to see and learn more about the surrounding cultures of this part of the world.  I simple did not have enough time.  One could easily spend hours here.
jjabagi,89,Feb 2016,February 2016,50,Excellent and lots to learn and see.,"It was a great and interesting visit to the Asian Civilization Museum. You can take the MRT to Clark Quay  station and it is 10 minutes walk. The museum is well laid out and lunch time they have a free concert band playing on the second level. I definitely recommend a visit to this museum. Also, when you are done there is a nice little restaurant to have a delicious cup of coffee and desert or a luncheon."
Ebie_MUC,111,Feb 2016,February 2016,30,Disappointed by relatively few displays,"There seems to be a lot of renovation going on in the displays, perhaps that's why there was relatively little to see. Was surprised how little there was about Singapore, more about neighboring countries. Displays were nicely done, but saw all there was to see quite quickly."
LeslieChoo,45,Feb 2016,November 2015,40,Collections of artifacts that reflects Singapore's cultural background,"This is a good place to learn about the cultural background of Singapore, an indoor attraction, suitable for bad weather condition, and time limited travel."
VLA84,90,Feb 2016,February 2016,40,Informative and interesting.....,A small but beautifully laid out museum. The exhibits are interesting and easy to follow and admire. I was fortunate enough to visit on the day of the first ACM lunchtime concert of 2016 which was really enjoyable.
Terry Y,313,Feb 2016,February 2016,50,Museum by the river,Asian Civilisations Museum(ACM) lives up to its name. Located right next to the Singapore River and near historic landmarks where Sir Stamford Raffles first landed in Singapore. There are 6 galleries featuring exhibitions of South East Asian origins such as Tang shipwreck and religions of Hinduism and Buddhism.  It just underwent a refurbishment adding a cafe and Chinese restaurant.  Best views of the river and its lights.
Frank M,6,Feb 2016,October 2015,50,Worst to Visit,"This is a must see museum. they have a rich collection of asian history relics, prestented in an extraordinary way."
ihui,"1,054",Feb 2016,February 2016,50,Small but Interesting,"Its a pretty small museum with a little of everything from everywhere around Asia. You get an idea with the culture, arts and history of the places without an overflow of information. <br/><br/>When you buy your ticket, ask the reception for the schedule of the guided tours. These tours are provided by volunteers who are interested in certain aspects like religion or culture in general. They provide their personal insight and understanding. I actually liked the way they explain things compared to some professional guides who are like recordings that repeats itself without showing much enthusiasm."
Patrick C.,129,Feb 2016,February 2016,40,"Nice, but you should be interested ","Very nicely done museum, although apart from the beautiful treasure exhibition which you shouldn't miss it is in general a bit specific and you should definitely be interested in Asian history. Great cafeteria!"
Kita U,768,Feb 2016,October 2015,30,Discovering Asia through yourselves and others,"This place is intergrated all of collection that tell story about Asian. There is free of charge. Period I come, there is a night museum in weekend that go light and sound of 50th year Anniversary of Singapore.<br/><br/>English Tour guide is good and Charming."
Wilfred,70,Feb 2016,September 2015,40,Passageway through time,"The ambience and layout of the museum is very conducive. A walk down the halls is like walking through a passageway through time, showing me the artefacts from various eras. Good to visit at least once !"
EdwardLSL,193,Feb 2016,December 2015,40,Treasure Trove of SEA,"This museum is definitely worth going. It is free for locals, and provides much information on the South East Asian heritage."
Atif K,39,Feb 2016,May 2015,50,Great Place and must see,"Great place, lot of collection and lot to learn. It is advisable to visit at afternoon because its not very full at that time. Everything is great expect annoying Queue."
Jgdutyfree,102,Jan 2016,May 2015,50,More history than most.,A vaccinating afternoon of Asian history and culture captured in one building.  Last time I went the dining in their restaurant was delightful.
mcsc-squared,973,Jan 2016,December 2015,40,Good to discover more about the area,Good place to visit if you want to learn more about Singapore and the area. Nice location across Fullerton Hotel and on Singapore River. Good exhibits.
Michael D,88,Jan 2016,January 2016,40,Very Good Small Museum,Very nice small museum. Friendly staff.  I would recommend checking when they are offering free tours and arrive at that time. Great place to get out of the heat for a visit of  1 - 2 hours including one of their tours. Located near the quay's. Beautiful older building. Nice upscale cafe over  where you can get an afternoon snack/treat after visiting.
jaybeeFL,"2,495",Jan 2016,January 2016,40,Tang Shipwreck a Must,"Although much of the museum is focused on Asian civilization and rightfully so, we found the Tang Shipwreck exhibits to be incredibly interesting and educational. It follows the seaborn trading routes and the probable route the Tang took prior to its sinking. The pottery that was found with the wreckage was amazingly intact and was incredibly detailed and intricately designed. Well worth the time."
JimKKTan,234,Jan 2016,October 2015,50,interesting for halloween night,came on Halloween night and it is interesting place to be at. many exhibits and also learn more about asia history and the many artfacts. great place to know some history
MDR_11,671,Jan 2016,November 2015,40,Interesting...,As decided NOT shopping this visit (the clothing here has become MORE expensive than home) we decided to spend more time visit some of the city's cultural venues.<br/>This museum provided an interesting history of the region.
wayne j,98,Jan 2016,December 2015,40,If Your New To This Part Of The World,This is the place if you are interested in more than just shopping on Orchard Road and eating at a Hawkers market. Take your time and understand what its all about and you will come away with a lot more appreciation. My 11 and 13 year old were impressed!
brwydave02,232,Jan 2016,January 2016,50,Our second vista in 8 years,"We still think this is one of the best museums in all of Asia, a nose ahead to the National Museum in Taipei.  Put in on your must see list."
IndiTales,460,Jan 2016,January 2016,50,A walk through the history of Asia,Small museum with lovely displays. Highly recommend taking their guided tours to understand the highlights of the museum. Time to time they have some temporary exhibits - check them out.
George L D,120,Jan 2016,February 2015,50,Insightful!,"Get a chance to discover many interesting things about the Asian culture, history of Singapore and many other interactive stories. The museum is very nice and it has some trendy virtual guides which you might enjoy."
AussieItchyFeet_13,210,Jan 2016,December 2015,50,Wonderful Collection,For history buffs this is a must-see.  It has a great collection of pieces from relatively obscure sources e.g. the Cham empire.  The pieces are also wonderfully curated.  Well worth a visit
GloriaLim,69,Jan 2016,November 2015,30,A great place to learn about Singapore and history of Asia,The exhibits stay pretty much the same unless there are some thematic exhibits flown in. Currently under renovation so we did not see much and there used to be Indochine to chill out and now there is a new hangout but at higher price. A family destination in the day and by night a hangout for the upper class.
Curtain12856,56,Jan 2016,January 2016,50,Excellent guide,"We had a guided tour of the museum with a volunteer guide, Joanne, who was excellent. She led a varied group through a series of fascinating exhibits, finishing up wth the Tang shipwreck exhibit. After her tour we were so impressed with the museum that we went back for a second look."
Arpita R,34,Jan 2016,March 2015,30,nice,"its nice, talks about singapore history. History of tribes of near by countries. some sections were closed so couldnt visit"
niessensan,126,Jan 2016,January 2016,50,Always Interesting,"Beautiful old building in a splendid location. Excellent collection. Good dining options. Well-constructed exhibits. The museum shop has good books, but could be more exciting. On the whole, always worth visiting."
Epicure134,201,Jan 2016,January 2016,50,Wonderful free tour from a great guide,This is an unsung jewel of Singapore which no tourist or local should miss.I gather they change items displayed quite often as they have such a rich store of fabulous treasures from all over Asia.The free one hour tour is informative fun and stimulates any visitor's interest.There is quite a good cafe there now too.Not to be missed.
cherrybrookchick,100,Jan 2016,January 2016,50,Wonderful historical collection,A wonderful collection of artifacts collected from many different Asian cultures. My 5 year old  particularly liked the exhibition on the Tang Shipwreck from 9thCentury China. The preservation of ceramics collected from the wreck is simply amazing.
XiaoYao98,25,Jan 2016,February 2015,40,My visit there,"Went there a few times, not a bad place to visit in Singapore if you are interested in knowing Singapore history and the place is fully air-con so that you can get away from the strong sunlight."
Stephanie K,116,Jan 2016,January 2016,40,Free English Tours,"We particularly enjoyed an exhibit about Chinese scholars--their place in society and their habits and environments.  Friends enjoyed the Tang shipwreck exhibit.  And we learned a lot about the confluence of southeast Asian civilizations during a free tour given by the museum.  Check the website for free English tours, which are given several times most days.  If you're a bit late for a tour, you can just tag in and join it.  The museum is now undergoing renovation which is scheduled for completion by March 2016.  Nonetheless there's lots to keep you busy for an hour or so.  The gift shop is a bit disappointing--not real big, but maybe that will change when renovation is complete."
Phyu,62,Jan 2016,January 2016,40,Fantastic. Go with volunteer guide.,Really interesting and well set up museum and a lot of interesting artefacts and rich history. Guides will accompany you at certain times and are brilliant.
sachin_maverick,40,Jan 2016,August 2015,40,Night Show visit,Asian Civilisation Museum is the main attraction at the time of night shows and the performances is awesome.
Nora M,1,Jan 2016,September 2015,50,Birthday outing,Ver peaceful outing with lots to see and do. Several exhibitions are extremely enchanting and lovely. You can easily spend hours here.
dizzyfizzy45,268,Jan 2016,January 2016,40,Shipwreck exiibition is worth seeing,The shipwreck from 830AD exhibition was amazing .The artifices on display so well preserved .Well worth seeing .<br/>The other galleries had interesting articles to see and learn about .<br/>The staff were very friendly and helpful .
M9574WEpeterc,5,Jan 2016,January 2016,50,Very Interesting,We visited on our last morning. Could have spent longer there as lots to see and read. Thoroughly recommend everyone to take the time to see what's in side this beautiful building.
981hanaa,2,Jan 2016,December 2015,40,Beautiful artefacts,Love the artefacts at this museum! Spend a wonderful afternoon checking out this place. There is also guided tours.
GlinysW,"1,122",Jan 2016,December 2015,40,Tang shipwreck exhibition and lunch,"We had read about the shipwreck found off the coast in 1998 full of ceramics from the Tang dynasty of China. It was well worth a visit. The items are well curated and include gold and jewellery as well as ceramics- the point is made that commercial links between China, South East Asia and the Middle East are much older than had previously been assumed. We also had lunch in the museum's new Empress Chinese restaurant. It was very good with views of the river. The food was light, tasty and beautifully presented. Service was courteous and attentive but not overbearing. It makes a nice change from the usual gallery fare."
bomnycsfo,28,Jan 2016,December 2015,30,Decent exploration of Singapore's various cultures and its history,"The museum was in a good setting by the Singapore River, housed in a stately colonial building.  The exhibits were easy to enjoy, but were somewhat sparse.  Perhaps the most captivating exhibit was a temporary art installation made of colorful paper.  It is a serious museum, not too appealing to kids; better suited for people who care about Singapore's origins and its current cultures."
stpn_fz,524,Jan 2016,July 2015,40,Landmark.,"- as the name suggests, it features artefacts from the Chinese, Indian and Malay civilizations<br/>- includes a small collection of items unearthed from the Singapore River banks, e. g. Ming-dynasty porcelain<br/>- guided tours available in English and Mandarin<br/>- themed events and talks held regularly, see website for details<br/>- within walking distance of Raffles Place MRT station."
Rod A,26,Jan 2016,December 2015,50,This has a Fantastic collection,This was the culmination of the old Supreme Court and the town hall. The collection of art from all around Asia was excellent. And the building itself was easy to negotiate. Sometimes it was like a rabbit warren and I did get lost but the galleries were big open and able to accomidate groups of people.
AnisaF,34,Jan 2016,December 2015,40,Blast to the past: Asian Edition,"The museum is located near the station, just a short walk and cross the Cavanaugh Bridge and you'll be there. <br/><br/>There's entrance fee but it's not too expensive. The galleries give visitors a glimpse of the products of civilization in Asia (pottery, jewellery, fabric and literature), from Southeast Asia to Middle East. The artefacts displayed are well preserved too. In some corner, there will be interactive display that shows people humming their traditional song. <br/><br/>A nice and enriching experience overall. Suitable for history buff, couples or family with children."
LovetotravelSGMY,412,Jan 2016,May 2015,50,Many Different Themes,Love love this place.   Though I have to pay to enter at tImes FOR special exhibits.  I have been to this place often.
hina agarwal,183,Dec 2015,September 2015,40,"Informative, interesting",It has multiple levels presenting history and culture of various Asian countries. It is very nicely presented and maintained although it's pretty small ad can be covered in an hour or two at max.
nova4traveler,36,Dec 2015,December 2015,50,You could spend hours or days here,"A wondeful overview of Southeast Asian art and culture.  So much to see and so little time (for a tourist).  If I go back to Singapore, I am going back here."
Cole S,171,Dec 2015,December 2015,40,"Cheap, informative, expansive!","Great day out, informative videos and interesting exhibitions.<br/>At the time, there were exhibitions on religion over time in SEA, was great. There was a fantastic contemporary exhibit of paper weapons (rifles, pistols) which fold out into beautiful flower shapes.<br/>There was a modern exhibit which consisted of two giant grains on rice. I did not understand it.<br/>An interesting part was on the role of scholars in ancient Chinese society.<br/>All in all, it is a good museum definitely worth a visit!"
HappyTravellller,473,Dec 2015,December 2015,50,Indulge in the past which now become present,"One of the best museum if u feel like going back in time to many many many centuries back. The spacious of the museum allows u to let ur imagination runs wild, as wild as they want to be."
YapYoongSiang,3,Dec 2015,October 2015,50,Full of Asian cultural exhibition,The first time I was visit the Asian Civilisations Museum and view the Dynasty Chin item. I feel that there are a lot of the history knowledge to be learn
S8W,50,Dec 2015,December 2015,40,Worth a visit: a nice surprise,"Singapore is such a small country to host such a collection of artifacts. What a nice surprise. There were collection about Buddhism, which provides an overall view and understanding of the origins and development of Buddhism. It also opened my eyes to Hinduism, and even Islam. There are also small sections, just to whet the appetite about the cultures of Vietnam, and so many other small groups of indigenous people in south east Asia.<br/>The museum building itself is beautiful, being an old colonial building. The care of artifacts with near world class control of temperature, lighting also add to the experience. <br/>Even the coffee shop setting is nice for a rest in between an enjoyable afternoon.<br/> This can be a very nice option to add to the other attractions that Singapore provides vacationing families."
Saad E,53,Dec 2015,May 2015,50,Often not highlighted as one of the best meuseums in Singapore,"It was a rainy day in Singapore and I was walking around Marina Bay.<br/>Suddenly I stopped by this museum and got interested.<br/>I am glad that I did,<br/>Besides the national museum of Singapore, this museum taught me so much more about the history and culture of Singapore.<br/>Visiting Singapore is great. But visiting a place knowing it's culture and heritage is even greater.<br/>Give it a try for 2/3 hours and you would like it."
linusthomson,13,Dec 2015,December 2015,50,Exceeds Expectations with a wide array of Asian antiques!,This place is amazing! You will be surprised by their variety of asian displays. It is a very comprehensive museum as it involves different countries' culture. They manage the museum great as well. Proper lighting and nice interior design make them even more appealing.
ddpark,32,Dec 2015,December 2015,50,Fascinating!,It was a nice surprise!  A vast array of displays.  From the creative to the intellectual.  The tang ship wreck was especially interesting.
Maryngshwuling,129,Dec 2015,December 2015,30,A Visit to the Asian Civilisations Museum,Today we visited the Asian Civilisations Museum.  The guide is very interesting.  She is a volunteer but she is very experienced.  She has many stories to tell us.  My students enjoyed taking photographs there though we cannot use the flash lights.  There are many security Guards there to maintain order and make sure that the art work there are safe.  There is also a souvenir shop and a cafe there.  It was a memorable day for most of us.
YurPlayt,50,Dec 2015,January 2015,50,AMAZING!! A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!,This is an experience that holds its own!!!! A memorable experience of culture and art at its best. The life size statues are depicted in story-like detail and modelled to perfection. At times you'd look twice to see if they are not looking at you. Lots to do and lots to see in here...all animated which makes it a really great and worthwhile tour. Take your kids!! They'll love you even more!
thejetsettergirl,755,Dec 2015,October 2015,40,"Small, free museum.","This museum is just across the bridge from the Fullerton Hotel. There's no admission fee, but you should still stop by the reception counter for a map. Unlike the National Museum where there's a lot to read and lots of commentary, here you mostly have artifacts and ancient art pieces with placards providing a brief description. It's definitely worth a stop by if you're in the area."
WallyNewJersey,49,Dec 2015,November 2015,50,Fantastic for understanding the cross-cultural aspects of Asian art,"For more than two millennia, along the land and maritime trade routes in Asia (Singapore lies on one) a fascinating set of artistic and cultural interchanges took place. We see,<br/>-- Greek art influencing Gandhara Buddha statues<br/>-- Chinese drawings influencing the features of Persian miniatures.<br/>-- Islamic motifs penetrating Tang and Ming designs.<br/>-- Indian sculptural forms modified in Indonesian and Khmer statuary<br/>-- Peranakan culture which is a beautiful blend of Indian, Arab, and Malay forms and cuisines<br/><br/>Their collection is small (compared to say the V&amp;A or British Museum in London where one can easily get overwhelmed and lost). The Asian Civilizations Museum's size is just right because of the narrow focus on Asian interchanges and it is just right for a delightful day's visit. I also especially commend their bookstore where hard to find books on Asian art are available. <br/><br/>I almost always visit the museum when in Singapore. it is a highlight and a delight.<br/><br/>The only cautionary note I would gently and politely suggest is that the curators be extra careful in checking the provenance (or to put it bluntly -- the authenticity) of a couple of their acquisitions."
AliceVonStein aka Mildred,63,Dec 2015,November 2015,50,Impressive history of Asian cultures over the years,Rain or just hiding from the sun this museum is worth visiting more than once. You learn from history and will appreciate even more all different cultures known as Asian.
Jupiter1010,44,Dec 2015,November 2015,40,The guided tour is highly recommended,"This is an interesting museum, where exhibits are well displayed and presented. With little prior knowledge of Asian culture and civilisation, I took the guided tour which was led by one of the museum volunteers. Our guide was knowledgable and highly professional as she took our small party on a journey through the museum stopping at a sample of exhibits which illustrated her story. The coherence of the narrative and the insights we gained into the artefacts on display are not those one would normally gain from browsing the galleries. By the end of the one hour guided tour I truly felt that I had learnt something and broadened my understanding of the history and culture of South East Asia.  Excellent!"
edhio_mobile,157,Dec 2015,September 2015,40,Nice Interior,"The museum had nice modern interior inside, even from outside its look a nice old building, the content is about singapore history within asian countries..."
AntAtoll,15,Dec 2015,November 2015,40,impressive collection,"This isn't a huge museum and won't take you all day or many days to go through it.  But despite it's relatively small size, the collection is top notch.  Currently there's an exhibit from an ancient shipwreck which is very interesting and well-presented.  The permanent collection on display is fantastic, as well."
JBart,"6,575",Dec 2015,December 2015,50,Re-opened now,Excellent museum with many stunning pieces. The signage in English is extremely good and very informative. If you like small high quality museums this one fits the bill.
Tandee827,10,Dec 2015,June 2015,50,Lovely building and interesting musuem,"This free museum offers a great introduction to numerous cultures, religions and history in Asia. There are many stunning pieces of art including a small sections that would interest children. Plus, the building is air-conditioned, so it is the perfect place to spend a few hours trying to escape the heat and humidity!"
SBams14,170,Nov 2015,November 2015,40,Partly closed for refurbishment,The museum was partly closed for refurbishment when we visited at the beginning of Nov. - only the ground floor was open but the admission was therefore free. The exhibits were lovely.
kat_d9152,56,Nov 2015,June 2015,50,So much to see,"Singapore has some of the best and most reasonably priced museums and attractions I have ever seen. ACM is no exception. It is literally packed to the rafters with floors and floors of interesting artifacts. <br/><br/>If you want to learn about all kinds of Asian History and see some amazing artifacts this is the place to be. <br/><br/>Pro Tip: Check on their website to see what time the guided tour runs, as the guide I had was phenomenal and the tour really interesting. If you have time, don't forget to wander around after the tour too, as there were so many things I was too busy to notice the first time around."
Jeffry b,"5,199",Nov 2015,September 2015,50,A great museum,"This museum is one of the best in Asia. The collection is superb and the building, an old colonial era office, is marvellous. If you don't see any other mseum in Singapore, see this."
CelLisboa,23,Nov 2015,November 2015,50,Excellent museum,"Top notch museum like the best around the world. Great exposition, beautiful architecture, cafes and gardens."
Dan K,151,Nov 2015,January 2015,40,Amazing Collection,"Located just off the Singapore River, this colonial style building houses many interesting displays depicting  Asian culture and history. The location stands near the hot bed of early settlement in Singapore and from here, one can walk across the metal bridge to see more historical sights, too many to describe. All together, this can be at least a half day adventure. Check out some local fare at the Telok Ayer Food Market."
Wayne R,47,Nov 2015,November 2015,30,Glad we went,"Amazing collection. Eclectic collection of many most important aspects of Asian Civilization, like rice development and cultivation, architecture, religions, jewelry and fabrics."
Joanna T,166,Nov 2015,November 2015,30,For those who like ancient artifacts ,"Asian Civilizations museum is 5 mins walk from raffles place mrt. You have to walk across the cavenegh bridge to get to the other side of Singapore river. Quite a beautiful sight and a lot of tourist are around the area taking photos. Until 30 December, entrance to this museum is free for all. Otherwise, there will only be free entry for Singaporean and PRs. Compared to the National Museum, this ACM has lesser stuff inside, and the architecture is less amazing. ACM focuses on ancient artifacts in SEAsia while national museum focuses on explaining Singapore's history. It really depends on individuals preference.<br/>It takes about 1-2 hours to complete the exhibits properly."
Quokkar,46,Nov 2015,October 2015,50,One of the best to visit,The museum is well worth a visit - many well researched artefacts are displayed here especially those from South East asia
DKF808,189,Nov 2015,November 2015,50,Its free!  Do take the guided tour.,"Small and interesting museum that shows the different Asian cultures and how they have influenced the ethnic mix in the area.  The guides are expats that volunteer their time and have educated themselves very well on how trade, intermarriage, and cultural traditions have all impacted the South East Asian region."
Nita P,63,Nov 2015,November 2015,50,Nice ,I walk from hotel to museum nice I had chance to know more the history probably the best museum in Singapore.
Shoshanna149,12,Nov 2015,October 2015,50,"Amazing collection, best museum in Singapore!","This was by far the best museum in Singapore. Entry was free and the collection was beautiful and extensive. Not just great for art lovers, there is a lot to see for everyone. It is not very large so easy to do in about 2 hours and doesn't get boring. The exhibition is set up beautifully and is very well kept. A collection book is available for sale but unfortunately sold out when I visited."
Cartertravels15,192,Nov 2015,October 2015,40,Impressive building,Went there a couple of weeks ago.Unfortunately not all areas open yet.The guides are volunteers and are so knowledgable well worth going with them on a tour.Their English is excellent.
dayanalaksminta,100,Nov 2015,October 2015,50,Halloween Night at ACM!,We was there when Halloween event was exist there<br/>Sooo in love with this museum but we will definitely back to take a picture at the daylight because we havent took any pic at that night :(
CycleVon,231,Nov 2015,October 2015,50,"An introduction to Asian culture and history, and some beautiful artefacts","As a precious reviewer said, there was a reduced experience because of refurbishment.  However, what was on offer was plenty to provide an introduction to better understanding Asian culture, religion and history.  Beautiful artefacts set out well, and informative explanation provided.<br/><br/>The museum shop has a good selection of gifts, and a great selection of books.  We bought a lovely book on the history of Singapore.<br/><br/>The museum is located at the riverside, and the whole area is interesting, with many colonial buildings nearby.  Once day we went, there was a series of boat races taking place with a noisy and excited audience cheering.  Statue of Raffles is also nearby."
David L,180,Nov 2015,October 2015,50,Worth a visit to gain knowledge of Asian history ,"Although undergoing a refurbishment during our visit, there were plenty of displays on show, providing a depth of information to provide visitors with a greater understanding of the culture and history of the South East Asian region. My preferred exhibit was the amazing tapestries"
pttbw,292,Oct 2015,September 2015,50,Good demonstration of ancient Asian culture,The free to enter ACM is currently undergoing major renovation yet there is still plenty to see within the galleries that are open. Allow approx one hour to see artefacts and religious items from south India through Burma and Cambodia to Malaysia and Indonesia. <br/>Avoid their restaurant though as the CocaCola is almost double what it costs outside.
frishki,"3,183",Oct 2015,October 2015,40,An insight of Asian civilisations,"The first good thing about this place is that the entrance is free. The second is it is air conditioned and it will be a great getaway from the singaporean (constant) heats. The third is, well, that this place will actually teach you and show you things you might not know about Asian civilizations. The whole exhibition is spread out on one floor, but with many artifacts come quite extensive descriptions so you can easily spend couple of hours slowly pacing through several rooms and halls. Also, if you're one of those that like taking photos of the museum items, you'll be happy to know you can do that freely. Oh, and did I say there's no entrance fee?!"
Kabby_Bhola,42,Oct 2015,September 2015,50,Mesmerizing Experience,Had a chance to visit this museum during the Singapore river festival. It is enormous both in-terms of size and the amount of relics. It has relics from different cultures &amp; different archaeological times.
Leonard S,"2,536",Oct 2015,October 2015,40,Beautiful Presentation,I visited this place at night when there is an art display of modern culture. They are just amazing and very creative.

Seniortraveler65,137,Oct 2015,October 2015,40,It provided an air conditioned stop,It was interesting but more than anything I needed to get indoors for a break.  It was free and the building itself was worthwhile looking at
KatharinaSTHLM,12,Oct 2015,October 2015,40,Beautiful presented artifacts and good insights in Asian tradition,"Worth a visit if you want to understand more about the Asian cultures. Wonderful presented and with informAtive texts. Right now under renovation, so limited access, but free entry."

SeeTheWorld1111,74,Oct 2015,October 2015,50,Still a great museum,"All exhibits are still on the second floor. Partial opening of first floor is expected mid November. I like this museum due to its broad coverage, high-quality, and accessible medium size collection. I hope you do too."
RoyLScam,452,Oct 2015,September 2015,40,"Insight into Buddhism and Hinduism, as well as Singapore","Visit this museum for a little background on Buddha and the political ties to Bodhisattvas, changing Buddha's focus.  Not only are the worship elements included in the museum, but different cultural influences on dress and worship, as well as weapons are in the museum.  Islam's influence is in a small corner.  The claim is that Christianity's influence is there, but I did not see any reference there whatsoever, despite British rule being a part of their past."
horsforthhe,55,Oct 2015,September 2015,50,Brilliant,"I went here when I was Singapore recently got the Grand Prix. I was there when there was a free tour and I have to say it was simply superb. Yes, there are all the flashy commercial things to do in Singapore but for a change of pace and something educational this is a must."
Abhimanyu T,19,Oct 2015,March 2015,50,"If you love Archeological history, this is the place for you","I have been to this place for more than twice, many things left to explore still. The collection and presentation is very good. I loved the Automated speaking Kiosks deployed around the Museum to facilitate the visitors. Best for an ideal person"
Christmate11,"2,319",Sep 2015,September 2015,50,Fabulous Southeast Asian Collections,"The museum is in an old British colonial building known as the Empress Place. It is small but very didactic and beautifully arranged. It presents valuable collections from Southeast Asia. Of course, there are many Chinese items. But there are sections reserved to many of the region cultural groups: Thai, Burmese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Malay or more specifically to ethnic groups like the Dayaks of Borneo or the Minangkabau from Sumatra. Really with seeing knowing that entrance is free!"
DrNona,112,Sep 2015,February 2015,30,Only if you have spare time,"Very impressive old building, quite small, but interesting exposition<br/>Of course this museum is not the very first site to visit while in Singapore"
Trying-to-Live-Well,86,Sep 2015,September 2015,40,A great education in a fairly short visit,Interesting and informative museum illustrating the history of settlements in asia and southeast asia.  A real education for those from North America or Europe not familiar with the religious and cultural history of this region.
Phil_OPKS,92,Sep 2015,June 2015,30,Wait until Renovations are Completed,"When I visited in July, many galleries and the grounds were under renovation and closed, but there was no entrance fee due to limited exhibits.  If the renovations are completed, I would definitely visit again.  Looks to be quite interesting."
pikeman666,48,Sep 2015,October 2014,50,Excellent museum of South Asian culture,If you are interested in the history of South Asia this is a must-see. The empires that existed before the western colonial powers were very impressive. This museum is an absolute gem.
Hasitha L,20,Sep 2015,September 2015,30,"""No Tripods""","I dont know why dont they allow tripods inside while allowing DSLR cameras , it has a dark background and tripod is a must to take photographs through DSLRs. Someone came and asked me not to use tripods.....but why???"
Richard L,50,Sep 2015,September 2015,20,Nothing interesting,"It could have been a great museum but it is small, disappointing and not interesting. Not to mentioned the toilets which might be the dirtiest in town."
rinchen d,21,Sep 2015,October 2014,40,mesmerising collection of artefacts.,"Asian civilisations museum in Singapore was one of the top places one should visit while in Singapore, because it has variety of artefacts from different places, mainly from places like Jakarta, antique things, gold jewellery with amazing designs from ancient times. they have an unaccountable collection of artefacts. so its a must visit place."
Dani L,64,Sep 2015,September 2015,50,A beautiful museum rich in information and exhibits,This museum is very informative. It taught me a lot of things about our culture and heritage as Asians.
HotEarth,703,Sep 2015,September 2015,40,A glimpse of Asian Civilization,"Besides a room of Singapore's (recent) past, there are quite a lot of south-east asian artifacts on display. A visit here is educational. Kudos to those who set up this museum."
Rei Rivera,38,Sep 2015,August 2015,40,Good for the history buffs,"The musem is quite good, Many things to offer specially for the history buff, cool thing is the entrance is free and they host assisted free tours every now and then."
MVI888,589,Sep 2015,September 2015,50,enriching and insightful experience,"With its mix of races and cultures, Singapore has rightfully earned a reputation for being the cultural melting pot of Asia. To showcase this diverse heritage, the Asian Civilisations Museum at the mouth of the Singapore River , it took us on a grand exploration of the peoples from around the region that have happily settled over the past two centuries. There are 11 thematic galleries displaying some 1,300 artefacts from China, Southeast Asia, South Asia and West Asia. The museum is far more than just a spectacular history lesson. We were drawn into the enriching and insightful experience with interactive spaces and activities. The Four Explore Asian Zones located throughout the museum offered a glimpse into ancient Asian cultures. It is truly an extremely interesting way to learn about Asian culture. Highly recommend the visit."
dnb1980,68,Sep 2015,August 2015,40,Interesting,"Is a very informative place. Take your time to go around when you there, you will learn something new.<br/><br/>I know I did"
windupgamecat,11,Sep 2015,October 2014,50,Outstanding museum,"This is one of the nicest museums I have been to, with a wide variety of exhibits and a great layout and location. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful."
Bee4,143,Sep 2015,March 2015,40,A very good museum; and one of many in Singapore.,A well-curated museum set in a magnificent old colonial building which once housed the Immigration Department. Located in the center of many attractions and well worth a visit.
sinclaired,279,Sep 2015,August 2015,40,Impressive Perspectives of Ancient Asian Times,"From a Caucasian visitor's perspective, the museum provides a most interesting depiction of many historical aspects of religious, cultural and everyday life of Asian civilisations. Of particular interest is the new Ancient Religions Gallery which focuses on the development of religions from India into China, Sri Lanka, and South-east Asia. <br/>Easy to access to the Museum from the City Sightseeing On/Off Bus Yellow route."
summerlea45,222,Aug 2015,August 2015,50,Stunning exhibits beatifully laid out - this is special,"I have been coming to Singapore on business regularly for years and never walked accross this part of Singapore before, came past all the old colonial buildings, such a lovely corner, all in the process of being renovated and out to use as cafe's, restaurants, art centres etc. This is 5 minutes from Boat Quay, just over the Clifford suspension Bridge. Although it is in the process of Renovation, reconstruction, enlargement, there is till plenty to see. I would go in (it is free at the moment) just to see the Terracotta Head of bodhisattya in the entrance to the main room (Just stunning) and some of the statues around it, but then you have gold, silver, jewelery in the two rooms behind. There is also a bight light room with an animal theme (skeltons and models) and a place for kids to play with masks.....colour....<br/><br/>If your conscience says ""we should do some culture"" - try this"
MrDavetheSarks,"17,443",Aug 2015,August 2015,50,Treasures from across Asia,"I had every intention of visiting this museum but it seemed to always just be out of my reach. However, on my last afternoon, before I returned to my hotel to be picked up for a tour, I finally managed to squeeze it in to my itinery. A part of me was expecting to see only a small part of the museum, however as it turned out I managed to explore the entire place, and still have more than enough time to get back to my hotel. Basically the museum contains a collection of artifacts from the numerous civilisations in around around Asia, including China, Vietnam, India, and other places. When I was here they even had a collection of artifacts from the Buddha museum in India. I must admit that I love looking a these ancient carvings, especially when they tell stories of the life of the subject (in this instance Buddha). In fact this exhibition was much more than just Buddha statutes (which is usually comes to mind when I think of Buddha). As it turns out you do have to pay to get in here, but due to the National Day celebrations coming up I even managed to get in here for free – bonus. They also had a room with had a Singapore specific display, but that room was rather boring. The ones with all the artifacts in them was much better."
Caverkat,426,Aug 2015,August 2015,20,Most of it is closed just like the other tourist attractions in singapore,"The website said only two gallerys were open so we were prepared although I still can't figure out why so much in one place, and across so many venues is scheduled to be done simultaneously.<br/>We took the free guided tour which I recommend as it provided an insight into the importance of the exhibits that could not be gleaned from the write ups."
NZKraut,22,Aug 2015,August 2015,40,Well worth it,"I was quite surprised by the amount of exhibits and their quality.  I went with my family and my 9 year old and 10 year old were captivated.  The museum is relatively traditional in that there are not a vast number if buttons to click and interactive areas,  however,  there are a number of presentations at stations with earphones that kept my children's interest up.  A wide range of cultures are represented -  I particularly loved the reliefs and statues of deities,  and the ceremonial cloths from all over Asia.  My 9 year old liked the ornaments and jewellery,  whilst the 10 year old went for the weapons and armor. It was busy but not overcrowded and of course the temperature is very agreeable. You could do much worse than stepping into this fine free of charge museum."
david_,63,Aug 2015,February 2015,20,Worth stopping by IF you are in the area...,"Somewhat boring but it is free! If you walk by it, go in and check it out for 15 minutes or so, but I wouldn't spend too much time in there unless you are very into the content."
cricketfanBB,230,Aug 2015,August 2015,40,Well presented collection of Asian artifacts,there is a little bit of a lot of things here. An amazing collection of jewelry especially the gold and silver
swagat2015,145,Aug 2015,June 2015,40,Truly representative of Asia in all its senses,The museum has a wide representation from India all the way to Greater china and everything in between. They also had very well maintained artifacts and relics. Definitely worth a visit if your a tourist or trying to reconnect with your heritage
Purplerainy09,170,Aug 2015,August 2015,40,Asian cultures...,They are renovating so there's some place that being closed down for it. And the access is a bit confusing because you have to walk around it to reach the front door. <br/>There's no entrance fee and there's Buddhist exhibition on the 2nd floor. They also have the heads that's being used by Jacky Chan in his movie the Chinese Zodiac...<br/>At the 1st floor there's a bit story about Singapore...

Also a great exhibition of ancient Sculptures from the indian Museum in Calcutta."
RitaJbris,11,Aug 2015,July 2015,50,A bit of history and culture,A great place to learn about the history and regional area. Plus the exhibitions are always worth seeing.

Lilicubely,25,Aug 2015,October 2014,40,"Just perfect, not too big or too small","I find the size of this museum just perfect, not too big or too small. It gives an overview of the Asian civilisation history in about 1 to 2 hours. The colonial style building is also very nice and well renovated. Check out the website, on certain evenings, or certain times, the entrance is free of charge."
Noob123,334,Aug 2015,August 2015,30,Dependent on Visiting Exhibition,"Very small place with not much to see.<br/><br/>Don't do this as a deliberate trip, unless the visiting exhibition is worth it."
Tom M,300,Aug 2015,November 2014,40,Worth a visit especially when there's a decent visiting exhibit,"This is a good exhibition space with a decent assortment of artefacts from various bits of Asia, well presented and with informative write-ups to hand. We first came here when the Terracotta Warriors were on display, and that was certainly a great exhibition, if you can find a time when something similar is on display, you will get much better value for money."
Kartos,233,Aug 2015,August 2015,40,Good museum for a curator's tour,"The museum has some very good artefacts from S. E. Asia. The Buddhist sculptures from India are very interesting to read about. If you get a chance, take a curator's tour where she explains the sculptures and the story behind each one of them. Guided tours are free and are organized on Friday evenings."
ytlouise,102,Aug 2015,July 2015,40,"Treasures from Asia's Oldest Museum Buddhist Art from the Indian Museum, Kolkata","I was deeply touched by the intricacy of the relics. Being a born again Buddhist, I found resonance with many of the treasures of display."
Alex,121,Aug 2015,August 2015,30,Good museum for a rainy day,"Large expansive museum with tons of Buddha pieces as well as SG and China historical exhibits. Definitely a good place to go on a rainy day, but I was beginning to get bored by the end..."
Timothy L,211,Aug 2015,September 2014,30,A different kind of museum,"The family decided to try the Asian Civilisation Museum. It's free for Singapore citizens and PRs and there are a lot of exhibits. However, some of the exhibits were disappointing and looked like not enough effort was placed in them. Would I go again? Sure, if they had new exhibits."
sabiLondon,20,Aug 2015,August 2015,20,Not much of a museum,After reading all the reviews I decided to see this museum with my husband and we thought it would take 2-3 hours. I have to say it was quite disappointing with not much to see and we finished in about 50 minutes. We have seen museums worldwide and I think this is the least interesting by far. <br/>I think there are much more interesting places to see in Singapore so spend your time elsewhere.
SOH KIEN PENG,"6,137",Aug 2015,August 2015,40,Into the Tunnel of ancient civilizations,"It was on 9 Aug 2015, our National Day. I took the free MRT to Marina Bay and Esplanade to view the Jubilee celebration by the Bay but shocked by the crowd there, I decided to walk across to Fullerton House to visit this unique museum. For Singaporeans, the admission to the museum is free.  <br/><br/>The neo classical Palladian architectural style building appeared spectacularly magnificent and imposing under the scorching hot sun as I walked across the Cavenagh suspension Bridge overlooking the shimmering Singapore River. <br/><br/>The museum was crowded. Contrary to my belief, Singaporeans have progressed to a stage of learning to appreciate the artistic, aesthetic value and the cultural aspect of life in our society and not just the materialistic and economic goals. <br/><br/>There were a total of 6 galleries in the museum. The exhibitions at the learning gallery on `Explore Unearthed: Singapore at 25, the `Discover Treasures from Asia's Oldest Museum at the Shaw Foyer and the `Experience Once upon a Time in Asia: The Animal Race' exhibition at Gallery 6 were thematic and not permanent galleries. The permanent exhibitions are those at Galleries 2,4 &amp; 4A on South East Asia. The museum has 2 floors, the lower floor housed the Unearthed Singapore exhibition while the rest of the galleries are at the upper floor. <br/><br/>The special exhibition Unearthed: Singapore at 25 showcased some of the policies initiatives, programs and campaigns of Singapore in the past years. I was surprised to see the Neighborhood Police Post logo among those at the defense category. This logo with the Policeman in Blue standing between two community partners was the initiative of the Ministry of Home Affairs to learn from the Japanese Koban system of community policing. I was the pioneer batch of policemen attached to these Neighborhood Police Posts (NPP) at Ulu Pandan and Bukit Timah. <br/><br/>I think the community policing policy NPP initiative was in the correct direction. While many police forces in the world are smeared with the bad reputation of corruption, high handedness and brutality, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) remains the clean and honest image among the people and continues to garner the support of the community in crime fighting. Two out of three arrests were made with the assistance of the public. SPF is like the fishes in a pond, without the mass support of the public (the pond), the fishes cannot survive. <br/><br/>The Buddhist artifacts from the museum of Kolkata were splendid treasures. I was amazed to see the elegant sculpture of the Head of bodhisattva outstandingly displayed at the center of the exhibition hall. It was marvelous creation an artistic masterpiece. <br/><br/>I was equally surprised to see the future world Buddha Maitreya carved in a sculpture bearing the image of a young handsome man with thick moustache. The sculpture of Maitreya  from India differs greatly from the big belly `laughing Buddha' image in Chinese Buddhist folklore.<br/><br/>The exhibition on South East Asia takes me on a nostalgic memory lane into the South East Asian countries I visited. The walking Buddha sculpture reminds me of the tallest standing Buddha statue I saw in Hatyai hilltop. <br/><br/>When it spoke on Theravada Buddhism and the Three Jewels, it raked up memories of my travels to the ruins of the ancient kingdoms of Sukhothai, Ayutthaya, the alms giving ceremony in the UNESCO ancient city of Luang Prabang and the Buddha Park in Vientiane. <br/><br/>When it spoke on the Hindu Buddhist Kingdoms, it connected me to my memorable trips to UNESCO sites in Cambodia and Indonesia, the Angkor Wat, the Borobodur and the Prambanan Temples in Jogjakarta. These magnificent temples were extraordinarily treasures so unique so spectacularly constructed that was unimagined architectural wonders in those ancient civilizations.<br/><br/>When it spoke on the tribal Southeast Asia, I remember the indigenous culture of the Dayaks, the Ibans whom I spoke to in Sarawak, the Hmong in Chiangmai, Laos and Vietnam whom I visited during my trips. <br/><br/>I was eager to learn of the Hindu kingdom of Cham and her culture in Central Vietnam and the Sincised South East Asia as I will be visiting Hoi Ann, Danang, Hue and Hanoi soon.<br/><br/>I love the diverse culture of South East Asia and each country has its unique distinctive feature that adds additional flavor and taste to my visit. Among the museums I visited, I think the Asia Civilizations Museum is one of the best as it sets me on a nostalgic memory lane  down the colorful culture in this part of the world."
Jim W,253,Aug 2015,January 2015,50,Immerse yourself,"Got to Singapore early because of flights, so trooped over to museum to discover local history.  Was not disappointed.  An enjoyable couple of hours"
Vegardur,12,Aug 2015,August 2015,30,Artefacts from the religions of East Asia,"At the time of my visit, most of the exhibitions were closed. The one that was open consisted mostly of religious idols from different parts of Asia. So if you want to see many depictions of the Buddha, this is the place for you."
GKSG1,76,Aug 2015,November 2014,50,Best museum in Singapore,"If you're coming through Singapore, this one is not to miss. Most probably one of the nicest museums about asian civilizations in all of south east Asia."
Roamergirl80,123,Aug 2015,May 2015,40,Interesting museum,"I liked the museum as it had an interesting collection. Also it is one of the few free places in Singapore. Some parts were closed, hopefully they will open them too."
Francismlee,137,Aug 2015,August 2015,50,Very exotic exhibits!,This place is a must visit if you are museum hopping. Its not very big but the layout of the exhibits and the displays are well thought out. Lots of antiques from around the region that really tell the visitor of the richness of the region
Allan1962,25,Jul 2015,July 2015,40,Good wet weather choice,"Its free to enter and some of the exhibits are loaned to the museum. One or two areas where closed for development work but this did not detract from our visit.  There is quite a lot to see for a museum in a relatively small country and the description labels are informative.  The museum exhibits are grouped into regional areas such as near East, S.E. Asia etc.  Some stone artefacts are similar to those you will see in any major national museum but there are also items you would struggle to find in any number anywhere else.  This is a good wet-day choice to take up a a couple of hours"

Rachaeld,575,Jul 2015,December 2014,40,Worth a Visit,"The Museum is worth a visit, it was very interesting, unfortunately we didn't get to see all of it as some parts of the Museum were closed for renovation. I would like to go back and see it all."
CarolyninAsia,46,Jul 2015,July 2015,40,Buddha Exhibition,We went to see the Treasures from Asia's Oldest Musuem of Buddhist Art from the Indian Museum at Kolkata.  We found it very interesting and informative and some of the statues are impressive.  <br/>The Museum was easy to access from the  Fullerton Hotel but there is a lot of construction  work going on around it at the moment.<br/>We always find an interesting exhibition to see at  the ACM whenever we visit.
Bentina T,168,Jul 2015,August 2014,50,Learn EVERYTHING about ASIA!,This museum was so informative and well worth an afternoon to explore.  If you want to learn about Asia this is the place and everything is very well done and easy to understand.  I felt so much more educated when i left and could have spent more time there reading exhibits and look at the artifacts.  An excellent museum.
VSSUBR,99,Jul 2015,July 2015,50,Awesome ,"When I went to the ACM, the first floor was closed for renovation. But the second floor more than made up for this.<br/><br/>I had the good fortune to visit the ACM when they had a special exhibit focused on Buddhist artifacts from the Calcutta museum. This spectacular exhibit walked us through artifacts from the first millennium BC and later. Curation was excellent. The floor also contained a blend of Chinese, Malay, and Indonesian exhibits, along with a wonderful jewelry exhibit. All adults in my group were suitably impressed - the kids (2 12 year olds and a 10-year old) were good for about an hour. I think they did learn something.<br/><br/>All in all, a wonderful experience."
SunLovers675,123,Jul 2015,December 2014,50,Excellent museum!,I very much enjoyed this museum! Exibit is well done and easy to follow. Location is central. Information available in many languages. Worth a visit!
MinaNKamal,190,Jul 2015,March 2015,40,Impressed,A very impressive museum with artifacts from different areas in Asia and a good explanation is provided... could be bigger in size.
etiennedubois,17,Jul 2015,July 2015,50,Well worth a visit even whilst refurbishment underway,Great location for this free museum. Join one of the guided tours to get the most out of your visit.

nyc1907,26,Jul 2015,July 2015,40,Free Singapore Museum,Finding something good that is free in Singapore is not easy. The Asian Civilization Museum is free.  Not a great deal in the museum and only the 2nd floor has exhibits right now. But it is interesting and worth a stroll through.
kamakshi2015,"1,909",Jul 2015,February 2015,50,Impressive and beautiful,"If you have time and have a rainy day and no outdoor activity then this is worth keeping on the iterinary . The beautiful building houses the history related collection . Very very impressive , informative ."

FeistyNZ,28,Jul 2015,July 2015,20,Wrong time to cone,"There are renovations happening so we could only see the second floor which was disappointing. What was there was good, however would have been good to be able to see more."
Babeliens,82,Jul 2015,November 2014,40,Great place to understand a bit of history of this part of the world,The museum has daily free guided tours. It is really worth while going on one of these guided tours as they provide a a focus an a context. This in turn enables to relate more to the multiple stories the museum explores.
sandra j,82,Jul 2015,June 2015,50,Wow what a museum.,"This lovely museum was under renovations.  However they did provide a smaller version of what amazing &amp; incredible pieces. This is one place I would return to when I next visit Singapire again. Beautiful Asian pieces of furniture, tribal costumes, Buddha statues, I could go on &amp; on.  If you like the history of the Indian Asian continent then visit this museum.  Thoroughly enjoyed my time visiting this peaceful elegant museum."
BillHarvey,141,Jul 2015,June 2015,40,Worth a visit if you're interested in history,"An interesting set of exhibits about sculpture, jewellery, costume and other aspects of historic life in a wide range of Asian countries."
Nordo4ka,55,Jul 2015,June 2015,30,"Best museum in Sg, but can miss if you don't have time","Frankly, it's best museum in SG, but if you've visited those in China, Taiwan or Thailand, you will be dissapointed on how few things you can see here... It's cos SG history is not like thousands years of kingdoms and wars... It has good intro to muslim culture though!"
Dianne B,129,Jul 2015,July 2015,50,Well worth a visit.,This is an extremely I interesting way to learn about Asian culture. Everything is excellently laid out.
RainerK265,9,Jul 2015,June 2015,50,Excellent free guided tours,Visited the museum on June 29 and joined a tour about the special exhibition on Buddhism. I was simply impressed by the knowledge and masterfulness of the volunteer museum tour guides! I really felt enlightened after the visit.
jennychai89,56,Jul 2015,December 2014,50,Complete good facilities museum,I love how it is convenient to tour around and introducing the asian history in a simple interesting way. The cozy environment and modern historical preserved building. It is free and worth the visit.
Marina C,64,Jul 2015,July 2015,50,Very educational,interesting museum. We spent about an hour there. Free for everyone.  We learned interesting things that we have never been exposed before to.
sarahsiny,13,Jun 2015,June 2015,50,Historical buildings with great exhibition collections,"On mid-June, we visited the Asian Civilisations Museum. Around 2 pm, there was a free guided tour and the docent led us to walk around the heritage. The exhibition is about Buddhism. The docent pointed out differences between South Asia, China and Roma's imagination to the Buddha. Also, on the other side of the heritage, also exhibits the marriage proposals and goldware of India. The tour lasted for 1 hour and after that we had a look on the other side. <br/>I think it is a good choice for those who do not like visit shopping mall in Singapore."
RWhitecross,55,Jun 2015,May 2015,50,Amazing,Wow! The quality  of the exhibits is stunning.seriously one of the best museums of Asuan art I have ever bern to. Great staff as well.
John S,778,Jun 2015,March 2015,40,well-organized and curated; informative,Possibly due to the timing of our visit (LKY week of mourning) the museum had few visitors.  The exhibits have good descriptions.  Plenty of pictures and other artifacts to explain the history of civilization in the area.
Mike W,47,Jun 2015,May 2015,40,One of Singapore's better museums.,"This renovated museum is better than most in Singapore. Usually, they are great spaces in wonderful colonial buildings but with little content. ACM has an interesting collection of sculpture, artefacts and textiles from around SE Asia and makes a decent attempt at telling the story of regional history and civilisations. That said, I wish Singapore would spend some of its huge reserves on going out into the international markets and assembling a wonderful collection of SE Asian art. Nowhere in Asia has a museum to rival, say, the Musee Guimet in paris or the British Museum and Singapore could afford to do it properly."
Sue B,38,Jun 2015,June 2015,30,A lot to look at,The collection was extensive and set out so it just kept unfolding. It was very hushed &amp; made it easy to become absorbed in what the artifacts. I felt there could have been more information about the purpose of different objects rather than just where they came from. There's a lot of work going on outside so it's hard to access. The toilets were in disrepair.
shreshthm,86,Jun 2015,July 2014,40,Good information comes in small packages,"This museum is a must see in Singapore. Systematic presentation of information in a simple but artistic way. Beautiful collection of historical facts, artifacts and deities. The presentation of Asian history, especially history of Singapore is fascinating. Puppet Stage and Gold Ornaments from the Forbidden Hill are fascinating. They also have a wide collection of Buddhist sculptures. <br/><br/>The walk to the museum is pretty along the river."
Sue B,476,Jun 2015,June 2015,50,Interesting and informative,The museum had some very interesting and varied artifacts. I didn't know anything about the culture or history of Singapore and I learnt a lot on this visit. Entry is free. Had a nice section for children.
Zzzz89,15,Jun 2015,April 2015,40,Beautiful and artistic,"For the visually artistic and aesthatic minds, this place is a must-go and must-see at least once in your lifetime. From colourful paintings to 3D Visuals and mind-boggling statues, the Asian Civilisations Museum is worth the trip."
Roberta C,370,Jun 2015,June 2015,40,Interesting even though half of it is closed for refurbishment,"Half the galleries are closed for refurbishment so only the ones on level 2 are open. They have therefore made it free entry, which is great. <br/>I particularly enjoyed the gallery on south east asian religions."
ineedaholiday72,186,Jun 2015,May 2015,50,A wonderful little museum,"Kids and adults alike will like this museum, there are activities and exhibits for both to enjoy. The surroundings in the civic district are also very pleasant."
DrJeeves,19,Jun 2015,June 2015,50,Free and fascinating,Really good museum with a very informative permanent collection about the history of various civilisations across predominantly South and South East Asia.   Collection is well presented in a modern style with highly informative information panels.<br/><br/>When I visited there was also an exhibition of Buddhist sculpture - with some exquisite pieces that were nearly 2000 years old. <br/><br/>I only had time to spend half an hour here but I'm glad I visited - could have spent 2 hours here easily.  Highly recommended.
Bev C,21,Jun 2015,June 2015,50,Spectacular museum,"We saw this museum while on a tour, so therefore only had limited time to view it. I could have stayed there all day. Loved the exhibits, the information attached to them, and it was a restful feeling just being there. The fact that there was so much ancient artefacts there, and the culture behind it all."
ElShintaPrimadona,67,Jun 2015,June 2015,50,A great place to know on the history of Asia,"Located next to the river opposite Fullerton hotel, I came here with my little family and we were greeted by a friendly volunteer tour guide, explaining on the history of the museum iself and the Asia in general. Along with a mix of other tourists from Asian countries, we had a great brief and admiring various  collection of the museum."
BeanieSydney,52,Jun 2015,July 2014,50,Interesting Place,"Well presented collection of artefacts and information detailing local and regional Asian civilisations through the years (as the name would suggest!). If you enjoy spending time in museums, put a couple of hours aside to visit this one - it's definitely worthwhile."
ralikirk,46,Jun 2015,December 2014,50,small but very interesting,"It's a lot about history and culture, definitely interesting and not that expensive. I love going to museums and I've got a free entry to this one from a visit to the Malay heritage museum. Would definitely recommend going to."
sipivu,"2,113",Jun 2015,July 2014,50,Asian history and culture,"This is one of the 3 national museums of Singapore. This one focuses on all the cultures and cub-vilizations of the Far East of Asia, from where the main ethnical groups of Singapore come from.<br/><br/>This is a rather small museum, but it is very interesting to understand Singapore.<br/>The are around the museum is also nice."
cabbages903,21,Jun 2015,March 2015,50,A worth-while visit!,An adventure of historical and cultural experience paired by a well presented and impressive collection of artefacts for both local and regional history.
Alan R,858,Jun 2015,January 2015,40,Understanding Heritage and History - a real gem,On going in to this colonial style structure you are immediately entranced by the simplicity and beauty of the place. It's one of the best museums I have been to museum and a joy to visit. For those wishing not only to view the Asian culture you also get a real appreciation of the trading history of Singapore and the man behind the name of Raffles.  Enchanting and highly recommended
lonelyrunner_91,142,Jun 2015,May 2015,50,Highly recommended,"If you're into in-depth southeast Asian cultures and history, this is the perfect place to visit. Some galleries are seasonal though. It might be boring to some though."
Marco R,172,Jun 2015,July 2014,50,Excelent Museum,"Singapore is a city unique, given the Asian quality of life it offers, this museum couldn't leave at the same level.<br/>Begins by explaining the beginnings of the origin of the town, as evolved to the present day.<br/>Is a museum with collections of various countries and various topics, ranging from agriculture, societies, trade and many other themes.<br/>Occupies a number of buildings of the British colonial era properly preserved.<br/>Who do an extended visit and attentive becomes enrich culturally because the Museum covers an area of the world with a great cultural diversity and addresses details that many people are unaware of.<br/>It is also a paradise in the middle of a city under constant heat, because the cooling system is excellent and we want to stay there longer."
C L,48,May 2015,May 2015,30,interesting items,"Enjoyed this, but many galleries are closed at present.What I saw was interesting, but I didnt get a coherent story. Entry was free because of limited access. Dont go especially, but do pop in if you are closeby with half an hour to spare."
Hizonfire,846,May 2015,September 2014,50,Must visit for Asian history buffs,"This excellent museum in the colonial part of Singapore covers the culture and civilizations that make up the ethnic milieu of the Lion City. It provides excellent background on the Chinese, Hindu, Malay, Khmer, Javanese and Islamic civilizations by presenting artifacts, relics and annotations that give context to not just Singapore, but the whole Southeast Asian region. Displays are presented well and the best thing is, you can enter for free on certain days. If you're a tourist or a student from any ASEAN country who wants an easy to digest but in depth knowledge about the region, this is the place to go."
maryrosalieo,71,May 2015,June 2014,50,Asian Civilisations Museum,"From modern to ancient.  The country has the National Museum of Singapore which is its oldest and the Asian Civilisations Museum that specializes in pan-Asian cultures.  Material history of China, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and West Asia from which the diverse ethnic groups of Singapore trace their ancestry are being exhibited in the museum."
jain_rakhee,12,May 2015,May 2015,40,Museum,"Good for history lovers, gives details of singapore about it culture and civilisation, kids might get bored, optional for the person to take or not in your itinerary"
Adrien B,45,May 2015,May 2015,40,FREE cultural &amp; historical activity,"Something FREE &amp; very nice in Singapore, what else could you ask for? :) Although part of the museum was closed for restoration reason, the opened part was very nice. A guide was also provided for free."
Simona S,13,May 2015,May 2015,30,Interesting but..,"But could be more interactive. Excibition is small enough, and it does not take much time, but there is lot of written material in the museum as well, so you can read the same on the internet."
1clor,24,May 2015,April 2015,30,Lots is closed at the moment,We managed to get in for free but only because lots of the exhibits were closed. I don't consider it to be one of the best museums I've been to. The exhibitions up got a bit repetitive.
TheGlobalFinn,274,May 2015,May 2015,50,Superb - if small - collection,Great way to get an impression of Asia - sort of highlights of the continent's history tour. You can do it in 30-45 mins. It's almost a crime not to go if you are staying near by.
VishwaMukhtyar,68,May 2015,December 2014,40,Interesting visit for a glimpse of South-East Asian past,Quite a collection of artifacts and information on various age-old traditions in South-East Asia. The section on musicial instruments was particularly of interest to me.
loppan06,26,May 2015,June 2014,50,Excellent museum,"This was a really good museum. We could have spent a day there, very intersting small exhibitions and a larger one that was of interest to us without great knowledge of the area."
Philip H,35,May 2015,May 2015,30,Satisfactory,"The building and the surrounding area is great, but the museum itself is a little disappointing.  Worth a look, but only an hour.  Nice walk around the precinct."
Nadnerb2,307,May 2015,May 2015,50,excellent,This is a fantastic museum and free. The Buddha exhibits here are wonderful. There is even a fantastic statue of Siddhartha Gatuma. Visit and enjoy
68Mick83,18,May 2015,May 2015,40,Cultural must in Singapore,"This muse like many other buildings in Singapore is undergoing extensive refurbishment in preparation for the 50 year Independence celebrations in Singaporw later this year. Despite this it remains a venue well worth a visit. Adjacent to the Singapore river in the Clarke Quay area of Singapore the museum offers free admission and a free local volunteer guided tour which lasts an hour after which you are free to continue your browsing at your own pace. The guided tour we had started at 11am in the foyer of the museum and was themed around the religious and social development of Singapore. Using the artefacts as a focus point for her talk the guide gave a fascinating insight into the beliefs and social development of Singapore. The building is beautiful and is being respectfully restored and the artefacts are tastefully exhibited. I highly recommend a visit, and try and time it to coincide with the very interesting guided tour."
Rissala,235,May 2015,January 2015,50,must visit,these are places which must be made a MUST G places for kids and people involved with the children. its a treasure house of knowledge and very well displayed too.
Geeess,"2,227",May 2015,February 2015,50,Great layout,Most good museums need a good layout and remnants of colonial loot. This has both. The loot from Indonesia India and other neighboring areas is well displayed but the story is confined to what they have.<br/>There are many interesting galleries on each major civilization and these are well curated .do get a guide from the reception by booking in advance.
Darren B,94,May 2015,May 2015,50,Great Museum with exceptional volunteers,"I really enjoyed visiting this museum.  They are currently undergoing renovations for the 50th anniversary celebrations of Singapores independence.  This means some parts of the museum of not accessible, but the beneift is that the museum entrance was free of charge.  Additionally the volunteer guide who guided me today was exceptional. Afterwards we were informed it was her 1st guide after 7 months of training.  The exhibition provides an overview of the mix of cultures that makes Singapore such a unique place.  I would highly recommend this museum."
abg112070,200,May 2015,May 2015,50,good insight on asian civilisations,"I went may 2, 2015 and was lucky the entrance was free and there were activities inside (kite making, Chinese calligraphy, museum tour, puppet show, etc) ... the staff were very accommodating and friendly ... whatever exhibit I saw was very good"
Jason0013,130,May 2015,March 2015,40,Queit... Informative... Wonderful Museum.,"Very quiet place in the heart of downtown. Lots of information about a wonderful region. However, I expected more from this museum. Seemed like it should have a lot more to it. Regardless, its worth the visit."
johnandmargaret2014,55,May 2015,March 2015,50,A museum not to be missed,We found this museum interesting and very informative. We spent nearly two hours studying the exhibits and think we might need another visit.
Christopher M,33,May 2015,May 2015,40,Free and worth the time,This museum is on the water close to parliament and Supreme Court. It gives a reasonable account of the mixing of influences that has made Singapore what it is. Worth a visit
JulesT25,27,May 2015,April 2015,30,A bit disappointed - partly closed,Very little of this museum was open the day we visited. They were doing renovations and so a lot of it was not available for viewing. They gave free entry and what was on display was very interesting.
Jody A,11,Apr 2015,April 2015,30,Visit once the renos finish,"While what they had was interesting, the museum is clearly going through a major upgrade at present. If you can, put off a visit here for few months. Can't complain too much as its free and a cool reprieve from the heat. The highlights tour is worth doing. Again, it's free and goes into interesting info you wouldn't get on the pieces otherwise."
Jarimalla,434,Apr 2015,April 2015,30,Informative small (and free) museum - visit if you have extra time,"The museum gives you a good overview of the history and cultural development of the South East Asian nations. The exhibition is built around various artifacts, mainly pottery and small religious statues. For me, the most interesting part of the exhibition was the story of the Singapore river development from a public sewer to what we see today that took place during the past twenty or so years."
RiddShah,74,Apr 2015,February 2015,40,Imbued with culture,This place has on display a number of collectibles. You should do this place if you are interested in seeing the stuff from the past. This place is very close to Merlion park so you can spend some time here and then move to the merlion.
andrewjohnporter,142,Apr 2015,NA,30,Ok but free,Renovations are taking place so only certain sections are open. They have a section with artefacts from across the region and also a section going over some of the history of Singapore and the river. There are free guided tours also which I believe are at 11 and 2 (not sure if they run every day though)
MD_T0urist,215,Apr 2015,April 2015,40,Mostly closed for renovation,"Many of the rooms were closed for renovation, but two key displays were available: the Asian artifacts and Jackie Chan's 12 zodiac animals.  The Asian artifacts were among some of the best I have seen in Asian, North American, and European museums, especially for artifacts related to Indonesia.  I gave it a rating of 4 only because of the renovation.<br/><br/>However, because of the renovation, it is currently free for visitors - definitely worth a trip!"
JennyPlesums,219,Apr 2015,April 2015,20,Pretty Empty,"They seem to be undergoing some sort of reorganization.  About half of the rooms were empty.  On the other hand, what was there was interesting and free."
San D,46,Apr 2015,December 2014,30,Nice museum if you're really interested,There is a lot of information in this museum about the civilization in South-East Asia. I've been there when I already lived in Singapore for a while and therefore it made more sense. I'm not sure if I'd liked it if I didn't know anything from the region already. Now I had some reference which made me remember more of what I'd seen.
123degrees,198,Apr 2015,April 2015,30,Singapore overview in free museum,"Colonial era building and free entry in this museum. Parts were closed but lots to see including native dress, Buddhas, brass drums, jewellery from many of the surrounding Asiian cultures. History of the trade along the Singapore river and Raffles contribution."
Littlepods18,327,Apr 2015,March 2015,50,One of my favourite place,"Must go even if you dont like musuems - take photos, walk along the singapore river. The exhibits always change so if you like do check out their last days so you dont miss it."
Lupin4,184,Apr 2015,March 2015,50,A rare find,"Entry was free. The exhibits were priceless. I also had a nice semi-private tour from a qualified guide to explain the exhibition to me. This was a wonderful experience, both in terms of personal service and the displays. The exhibits also change regularly. It's worth revisiting. Thanks to the Museum for their wonderful hospitality."
panggahardi,39,Apr 2015,April 2015,40,Very informative museum,"If you take MRT, stop at Raffles Place and exit at UOB Plaza. Take a right turn and you will see the building just across Singapore River. Cross the Cavenagh Brige on your right, to arrive at the building. The admission is free, and if you are lucky you can run into occassionally thematic seminars or art performances.<br/><br/>It exhibits vast collection of Asian history (especially in Southeast Asia region), although I am not sure wether the collection is original items or replica. Nevertheless, the information put in the museum is very complete, especially in Singapore River Gallery. It informs the making as well as history of Singapore.<br/><br/>Complete your visit by tasting a singaporean-style ice cream from a street stall just beside the bridge. Sit and relax under the trees in front of museum building, with ice cream in your hand, while hearing crows singing."
Anne88888888,245,Apr 2015,April 2015,40,Combine with Peranakan Museum visit,"suggest visiting the Peranakan museum before visiting this one, or the National Museum to give a good background to the history of Singapore.  Walk through the display of Buddhas to see some amazing jewellery and other artefacts from all over Asia.  Free entry at the moment as renovations are underway."
CrispNClear,348,Apr 2015,March 2015,40,Past Pass,"Traveling around Singapore is best (if you're not in a hurry to get to places especially if you have scheduled meetings) in trains and buses. In that situation having a fast pass or one ticket for a day of hop in hop out is the deal to get.<br/><br/>If you need to travel back in time before Europe discovered the treasures and advanced civilization of the East, going on the Asian Civilization Museum tour is the express lane to the history of Asia."
Mary B,20,Mar 2015,April 2014,50,CAPTIVATING!,"My family and I went to the Asian Civilisation Museum a year ago to look into the treasures it guarded. When we visited, We were able to immerse ourselves into the Secrets of the Fallen Pagoda: The Famen Temple and Tang Court Culture. We were amazed by everything we saw. Everything was in order and the place was immaculate. This place is a must visit. Be sure to take your time, as the Museum has an expansive collection of artifacts. Be on the lookout for discount vouchers in the MRT. We found a no fee entrance voucher for four, a day after we went. So look around. :)"
Betina S,42,Mar 2015,February 2015,50,learning about asia,Don't miss this gem! I went without expectation and for my big surprise I LOVED! its free. Please wait for the free tour because you will learn a lot.
Yung Y,26,Mar 2015,March 2015,30,It is a gorgeous building opposite Raffles Place Station,I like the theme of this museum.  We were unfortunate to find many of the rooms were closed.  (In preparation for Singapore's 50th years anniversary?) This is interesting to know about the culture diversity of Singapore  prior to the influx of Chinese and European settlement.  It would be better if all exhibition rooms be opened.
Damir R,"1,934",Mar 2015,March 2015,40,Unique,As per my (although limited) experience this is a unique place to get familiar with overall Asian Civilisations herritage.
Jon b,449,Mar 2015,March 2015,30,Nice to visit but lots closed on my trip.,Walking to the museum was made difficult by all the roadworks nearby. Arriving in the museum I was disappointed to see some of the galleries also closed for work. It seems that all of Singapore is in a state of transition! The museum though is serene and cool and worth the trip. There are some fascinating exhibits and some insight into the many different civilisations from this part of the world. There are some truly beautiful fabrics on display as well as the usual cultural artefacts. I was here an hour or so but left feeling I needed something more. I will visit again when hopefully more of the museum will be open.
Goin2doit,42,Mar 2015,March 2015,30,Disappointing,It seemed as though the majority of the Asian Civilisations Museum was closed when we visited though we had no information suggesting this until we arrived.  Check out what is open and maybe go again some other time.
tom8787,52,Mar 2015,NA,40,Educational,Pretty extensive museums for the history buffs. The best timing to go would be in the morning as there is not any people around. A must go for those interested!
Judith A,485,Mar 2015,January 2015,50,give yourself plenty of time,"This is such an extensive museum, with so many well-documented displays and exhibits that it requires considerable time and energy to see it on one visit. Good shoes are a must!"
Z0rglub,231,Mar 2015,March 2015,20,Small disappointing museum,"A small museum with nothing in it. Almost no history, a very few old pieces of art. You will see the whole museum in 10 minutes. Very disappointing for a city that big. Not worth it."
SomeshKumar,24,Mar 2015,March 2015,40,Nice Museum,This is a nice and neatly laid out museum. It can't be compared to museums in Italy or the ones in India. Not much of a history to showcase. It doesn't take more than an hour or two or cover it. Some galleries are really nice.
kthackett,39,Mar 2015,March 2015,20,it was ok,go if you have the time but really unless your willing to pay to go into each gallery (which we were on a tour and told we didnt have the time) but the area free of charge was ok!
golem67,648,Mar 2015,NA,40,Enjoyable visit!,"Worth the visit, the artistic Koran was interesting as were the depictions of the Buddha. Written descriptions okay and exhibitions well done!"
Laura S,130,Mar 2015,February 2015,50,Excellent museum!,Nice way to get out of heat as very humid here.  Great exhibits and nice layout.  A must see if you like museums.  Recommend for adults.  Easy to get to with the wonderful subway.
mnn17,233,Mar 2015,March 2015,30,Ok museum but most of it was closed,"The part of the museum that was open was nice, but when I was there most of it was closed or under reconstruction, but there was free admission, so that was ok."
GlasgowHappyscot,206,Mar 2015,March 2015,40,Varied exhibition well presented,Some of the museum undergoing renovation so limited number of galleries open.<br/>Very varied exhibition covering elements of the key ethnic groups in Asia. Well laid out and information is clear and some video presentations at the entrance to some of the galleries. Free during the period of renovation.
Ron W,37,Mar 2015,March 2015,30,Worth a look,I think every country has a Museum depicting their indigenous population and the influx of migrants that now make up that countries culture
David B,224,Mar 2015,January 2015,40,Pretty good museum,"A museum with statues of Buddha, Hindu gods, armor, jewelry, gold, headdresses, masks, tapestries.  Even if your not a museum person, you will want to visit this one."
carolanicoli,7,Mar 2015,March 2015,40,interesting asian religions focused museum,as a non-asian traveller it was interesting to discover the influence of asian religions in singapore.
BlessedBlessy,39,Mar 2015,February 2015,40,Worth the trip,Amazing museum.You will get to know more of Asia. The displays are well-labelled and the whole thing is completely informative. The building is nice and neat too.
chloe2011,11,Mar 2015,February 2015,40,Amazing museum,The museum is really amazing. You get to understand better the whole history and culture from the South East Asia. Too bad they are closing it for some renovation.
diouno,39,Mar 2015,January 2015,50,Superb experience,"Entering this traditional building one is stunned by the entirely modern and beautifully displayed and labeled outstanding collection. This is a world class museum and a joy to visit. Unlike most things in Singapore, museum entrance fees are modest and sometimes even offer senior discounts to non-Singaprians. A very worthwhile visit."
mykepyke,48,Mar 2015,February 2015,50,Great,A great museum. There is a lot to learn about Singapore's history and it is presented beautifully here.
gvodbos,317,Mar 2015,January 2015,50,Great museum if you want to learn more about this region,"Try to pick a guided tour, this adds a lot of value to your visit as the guides explain about the different Asian cultures."
Margaret B,109,Mar 2015,February 2015,40,informative,It was a great museum with so much to take in. If you are in to museums a great place to visit and take in the history of Singapore. Lovely building showing its colonial heritiage.
havaiisteve,143,Feb 2015,NA,40,Excellent ,About half the exhibits were closed due to renovations.   But what we saw was 1st class.  If you  take the  time to study what you're seeing you begin to grasp the the flow of cultures and religions doen the Malay peninsula and into Indonesia.  Buddhism and Hindu  then islam and more recently Christianity.   Religious tolerance  florishes in Singapore
Patrice H,62,Feb 2015,February 2015,40,Some culture at last.,"Singapore is such a new country that one struggles to catch the essence of it. Some colonnial buildings remain and streets are named after ancient prominent figures but nothing goes back more than a century or so. This museum is an exception as it gives us a feeling about the culture of south-east Asia, with a small focus on Singapore. It is fairly small but my kids did not complain (the tour took us an hour). Scenography is classical. Staff was nice and smiling. Entrance was free (to my surprise) so there are no good reasons to miss this museum."
lagomaggiore2013,306,Feb 2015,February 2015,40,Excellent museum BE WARNED SOME GALLERIES ARE CLOSED,"This is an excellent museum on the religions and culture of Asian civilisations and normally I would recommend anyone to go there, but from now until October 2015 only one gallery is open (generally there are 4) so if you can postpone your trip until October I suggest you do.<br/><br/>When you do go the free tours are excellent and are every weekday at 2pm"
inf91,167,Feb 2015,February 2015,20,Boring,"Some of the exhibits are ok, but mostly it was boring and very empty. Most of the exhibits were under construction, which made for a boring and short lived time. It was free, so I guess that was ok, but mostly it was meh. If you like Asian history, it is fine and there is lots about Singapore's history, but other than that, nothing at all. Not really worth going to be honest!"
kup79,2,Feb 2015,February 2015,50,"Oke, good, nice.",Good museum with many different halls describing many Asian nations over world history. In the city center and close to MRT metro.
Hofi18,427,Feb 2015,January 2015,50,For history lovers,"If you like history, visit the Asian Civilisation Museum. You will see interesting exposure from various parts of Asia - China, India, Sumatra, Malaysia and others.ACM is easily accessible by MRT."
KonradVP,81,Feb 2015,June 2014,30,Static,a bit boring. less rich than i expected. though well organized - as usual in singapore - but not so impressive
Jean Pierre L,5,Feb 2015,April 2014,50,Excellent museum,"The settings, the content, the location made the visit very interesting and worth the time spent. Probably the best museum in Singapore"
macneillfamily,209,Feb 2015,February 2015,40,beautiful museum in central position,"Easy to visit, well laid out, will only take an hour to walk around. Has some interesting exhibits and tells a history of singapore"
Jambo-TL,404,Feb 2015,January 2015,50,Very Interesting,"I found this very interesting, a lot of information packed into this museum.  If you are there, its worth a visit."
GlobeTrotting562042,7,Feb 2015,NA,50,Amazing and interesting !!! Now it's free entrance!!!,I planed to spend in this museum one hour. Finally I spent 4 hours and it wasn't enough. I liked the opportunity to watch video guides in every section. It's good idea and give you quickly main information about Asian civilizations.
SusanVM,755,Feb 2015,October 2014,50,A Cultural Overview,"After touring through all the cultural neighborhoods with our guide Wei, from Indie Singapore tours, we were very interested in the history of the people who first settled in Singapore. This museum filled in all the questions for us as it gave the history of these people and displayed beautiful pieces of their art and other cultural artifacts. We visited on a very warm Sunday afternoon and the air-conditioning was an unexpected blessing!"
Tony S,20,Feb 2015,March 2014,50,A+,"A fantastic collection of artifacts, well-curated so as to give the western visitor real insight into the pre-colonial history of Southeast Asia. The sections devoted to Buddhism and Islam are particularly good. There is also a good restaurant on site, a bit pricey but far from the most expensive in this City."
Leisa W,158,Feb 2015,February 2015,40,A nice way to escape the heat,"Singapore's midday heat is really HOT. This place is free, so it's a nice chance to learn a little, while freshening up in the AC and using the bathrooms."
Judithh12,159,Feb 2015,February 2015,40,Interesting museum and good overview of Asian Civilizations,Museum is under renovations and is free now.  I took the free tour and the guide was excellent. Gave a good survey and overview of  the museum.  The museum's collection is quite large and definitely worth a visit.
forensicsgirl,"1,726",Feb 2015,February 2015,40,Great museum,"I thoroughly enjoyed visiting this museum.  The exhibits are well organized.  The collection of religious artifacts, textiles, furniture, and jewelry was fascinating.  Information and regional maps greatly enhanced the exhibits on obscure Asian tribes.  I found myself wanting to learn more about these people.  The gift shop is small but worth a visit.  <br/><br/>While guests weren't being charged an entrance fee, the museum's brochure states there is normally a fee.  Perhaps, due to the renovation, the entrance fee is being waived?"
Chris D,228,Feb 2015,February 2015,40,Quite impressed and no cost!,"I am not a museum buff, but happily spent nearly two hours here yesterday without even seeing several rooms. Found the details describing the items and backgrounds very good. Separate rooms for various original countries. Good, small exhibit on trading on Singapore River was also interesting for us new arrivals. <br/>Happily will return for the other rooms soon."
Anniest64,19,Feb 2015,April 2014,40,Very very lovely,Walking distant from the Fullerton. Totally worth a visit. You should never miss this. I will definitely come back for more.
jpbb2015,21,Feb 2015,February 2015,50,A glimpse into a near forgotten world of infinite beauty,"Nothing to dislike - maybe a room closed here and there will lure you back; an outdoor cafe terrace would be a boon in the post-colonial formality of the old river bank - though even the Fullerton Hotel opposite doesn't quite manage to step into the role.<br/>Here you have the Barak and the Dayak, the cerebral intricacies of Zen Buddhism side by side with the rituals of the feared headhunters. Marvels of design in woven and tapestry fabric as a backdrop to the most ornate and encrusted ceremonial jewellery. Passive faces and fierce masks from peninsula and island peoples. All beautifully arranged, informatively captioned and stunningly lit. Set aside at least 90 minutes - more if you are a devotee of applied arts and craftsmanship."
Dew D,250,Feb 2015,February 2015,40,Worth a visit,"Many parts of the museum are still under renovation and not yet open to the public. The self-guided tour was easy to navigate with main exhibitions on the 1st and 2nd floors, including the Southeast Asia and South Asia galleries. Reading through Singapore's history was particularly interesting and so were the artifacts displaying the rich religions and culture of Asia. <br/>Admission is free and photography without flash is allowed within the museum. Location is conveniently located within minutes from Raffles Place MRT."
Charles K,"1,057",Feb 2015,February 2015,40,Worth a visit,This museum gave a nice background to the Asian culture. We particularly liked the bits about singapore. The staff must be overworked because we did find one of them fast asleep and snoring under a staircase. One final nice thing - it's free.
jill a,41,Feb 2015,February 2015,50,nice,nice small museum thats give you a breef information about the asian culture inside is well designed
arrahman74,264,Feb 2015,January 2015,40,For history lovers,"A museum like any other, so don't expect something unusual or astonishing. The sections on sun continent and Islam were closed so I didn't enjoyed a lot. Otherwise okay."
elisevin,32,Feb 2015,January 2015,40,Good,"Lacks a wow factor, but it is good. I went there for free, as it was Friday night. One hour well-spent."
Jasjhol,247,Feb 2015,December 2014,50,Well curated,Beautiful and well curated muzeum. Wish the prompters worked better. Some of the buttons are not working
mimiechouteau,82,Jan 2015,January 2015,40,wide-ranging exhibits,"a good opportunity to see works of art from many different asian cultures, and a helpful display on the early history of singapore."
S P,144,Jan 2015,May 2014,50,Superb displays,"For the history buff, the building itself is fantastic, and once inside, it just gets better. Displays of regional and local items are displayed in such a way that it's easy to follow both the geography and history involved. The range of items on display, from puppets to tools, pottery to textiles, religious artifacts, statues and more is exceptional.  A great place to spend a day or part of a day, with lunch or a sunset dinner on the terrace at IndoChine (just around the corner) the perfect finish. <br/>Kids can run on the wide sidewalks outside to burn off energy before or after a museum visit; there are often casual ice cream sellers on Cavenaugh Bridge in front of the museum."
Jero S,152,Jan 2015,March 2014,50,For those who like culture,"Amazing collection, a well organized, clean, huge building. Many things to learn, and for a cheap price... I recommend it."
Steven M,141,Jan 2015,November 2014,50,"Excellent museum, something for everyone","Visited the ACM for the first time in November 2014 since relocating to Singapore over the summer.  We went specifically to see the exhibit ""China Mania: The Global Passion for Porcelain, 800-1900.""  The collection told the story of Chinese porcelain and its global demand.  There were over 100 pieces selected and on display from the time period 800 to 1900.  We spent about an hour and a half seeing this particular exhibit.  It was very informative and well organised.  The museum has many different offerings during the year, really something for everyone.  It is one of the best museums I've ever been to and I'm glad to live so close so I can return again and again."
Brian G,42,Jan 2015,January 2015,50,Great Museum,"Too much to take in, but is shows s great historical perspective of the growth and development of Singapore. Every room has something fascinating and exciting to look at and understand."
Daniel CN,207,Jan 2015,January 2015,40,Asia Civilisation Museum,"The Asia Civilisation Museum is the first museum in the region with a broad perspective yet integrated pan-Asian cultures and civilizations. The collections reflect the ancient history of the country and the cultures that have settled here over the past 200 years from other parts of Asia. In particular, the museum looks at the groups that arrived from China, South Asia, West Asia and Southeast Asia. The entry was free and they gave us a pamphlet to orient. There is also the possibility to visit the museum with a group of people and a guide to a specific time set by the museum. It was a very pleasant time involved with the stories and artifacts that were on display."
100worldtraveller,29,Jan 2015,January 2015,30,Good Asian Displays,"If you're into Asian artifacts, this is the place. Honestly, it's not my cup of tea, so I was a bit bored. But, it is free right now while they are renovating part of the museum. I wouldn't have paid to enter."
zerella,405,Jan 2015,January 2015,40,An amazing travel through Asia,"The museum is full of masterpieces from all parts of Asia andits motto is ""Discovering Asia through purselves and others"".<br/>There an interesting part dedicated to the history of Singapore."
Katherine K,22,Jan 2015,December 2014,40,Interesting,"It is free right now, not sure why. We viewed an exhibit about Indonesia and the one on the history of the Singapore river - both very interesting. Plus being in such a historic building was an added bonus."
TuniB,35,Jan 2015,December 2014,50,A wonderful way to spend an afternoon,"If you like history and/or museums this is a fun and interesting museum to walk through. It is even appropriate for children (perhaps 9 and above) who themselves are interested in museums/history/culture. It's very peaceful, the building it's housed in is lovely and its location right by the river is perfect."
Paul C,211,Jan 2015,September 2014,50,Adefinite must see for any visitor.,I had been given a ticket to attend the Museum and only had a few hours to visit and wished I had given it more time. This is a amazing collection of artefacts and items covering the different cultures and the time covering from approx 300AD to 1900's. Each area is carefully curated to show the different cultures and the labels and descriptions enable you to gain careful onsite and knowledge of the culture and its impact on the Singapore area. I was fascinated to read of the history and influence of India on the area and the interaction on countries around eg Vietnam. The quality and provenance detail gave a clear line to what items were used for in daily life and where they had come from. It enabled me to build up a picture of the growth and lifestyle in the areas. I ended up walking around on my own as found particular interest in the background to Chinese porcelain and the trade with Europe. The detail and examples on display reinforced the strength demonstrated the level of knowledge that has been gained by researchers.  There were tour groups going through the buildings and the guides had an amazing level of knowledge and were able to explain clearly and simply what was being viewed. In the end wish I had more time as just so much to take on board. I found the knowledge gained very helpful when I travelled to Vietnam and could understand the background to their culture.
SoCalNativeGirl,22,Jan 2015,December 2014,50,Can easily spend an entire day here,"This is quite a collection of all types of artifacts, telling the story of each culture.  There are so many interesting objects you may never see elsewhere, that it is an opportunity not to be missed while in Singapore.  We waited until the last days of our trip before discovering it, so we didn't have enough time to read all of the signage attributed to each article.  Whether you love art, history, spirituality, weapons, music, or jewelry the most, the wide assortment of exhibits in each gallery is sure to please everyone in your group.  Put this in your top 10 list!"
Rhone_Man,305,Jan 2015,January 2015,30,Quite heavy going,"The Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) ambitiously tries to pull together the various threads of Asian civilisations, mostly from about 300 AD to about 1850 AD.  Perhaps understandably, many of the exhibits focus upon the pivotal role that historical Singapore / Temasek has had as the natural median port between the two great cultures for most of the world's recorded history - China and India (although the museum has less focus on the rise of Arabia and Muslim caliphates during their dominant period).<br/><br/>Intellectually it is quite rewarding, but it is still fairly heavy going unless you want to settle for a superficial ""glance at all objects"" style of whistle stop museum tour.  Frustrating, when I was there nearly 40% of exhibits were closed, although with hindsight I wondered if that was a good thing as I could imagine doubling the amount of time that I spent there.<br/><br/>Overall, I left with the sense that the ACM does a fantastic job of trying to protect and preserve its cornerstone of history, but it is maybe not the best stop for the casual visitor looking for some variation on other recreational attraction.  I certainly wouldn't commend it for families with young or teenage children - you'll have to put up with a lot of whining."
parklane44,201,Jan 2015,January 2015,50,Amazing!,"A destination within itself, you can easy spend many hours here.  Beautifully presented artifacts from ancient Asia.  At the time we visited they were still setting up various rooms within the museum, but there was still a lot to experience and its breathtaking with the most amazing lighting and information."
Janr20,"3,388",Jan 2015,NA,40,Asian history at its best,Really enjoyed looking at Asian history in this museum. Layout is very good and you could spend hours here. Good attention to detail and knowledgable staff. Found it very fascinating the evolution of different aspects of Asian Civilisation
Robert B,40,Jan 2015,January 2015,40,Quite interesting,"Good museum, which brings together the essentials of Asian culture. Well worth a visit, if you're interested in learning more about the cultures that make up Singapore."
Seema N,15,Jan 2015,January 2015,40,Its ok not that great,One of my friends was visiting Singapore and she insisted we go to Asian Civlisations Museum. The museum is ok and i was bored after a while.
UpInTheAirDoc,255,Jan 2015,January 2015,40,Pretty Good,"This museum provides a nice multimedia overview of the various Asian cultures that make up the population of Singapore. It has five sections: Singapore, China, West Asia (Islam), Southeast Asia and South Asia (India). A variety of artifacts and interpretations are provided."
TinaQ,"1,939",Jan 2015,January 2015,40,"Nice displays, some interactive bits","This museum was recommended by our tour guide book and it was truly interesting. The entrance fee was free, not sure because it was Saturday or due to on-going reconstruction that caused some parts of the museum to be closed off. The process of marking the exhibits in English is still ongoing, but there are leaflets and some interactive pannels as well as local art history academics that give tours of the museum. The exhibits were very interesting."

LondonerAbroad2015,11,Jan 2015,January 2015,40,Great museum,"Well-presented, informative and not at all boring. Quite an interesting museum especially for a newbie to the city/region - balanced and honest take on 'controverial' issues and topics too."
Shylajadevi,27,Jan 2015,December 2014,30,informative,"worth visitng and free of charge. a  great place to know about the history of Asean culture and origins.<br/><br/>quiet and well maintained, nice location for a walk"
NeverInOnePlace,85,Jan 2015,January 2015,40,A lot to see,"I'm not that into this type of museum where there are a lot of artifacts on display. I would have liked to see more costumes to give an idea of how the different cultures dressed. But there was a lot to see and it was well presented and the museum was very, very quiet. Considering the overcrowding at places like the aquarium a nice quiet walk around a peaceful museum was what we needed.<br/><br/>My wife is much more into this type of museum and she really liked it."
Mitch T,78,Jan 2015,January 2015,40,Excellent,"Because they are doing some renovations it was free to go in the museum. But still there is enough to visit and to learn about the history of especially South-East Asia &amp; Singapore. The historical information they share and the finishing touch of the displays are stunning. Its a very professional setup. You can spend easy around one or two hours here, there is a lot of interesting things to read and see.  Even if you not really into museums, this one is worth a visit!"
Joshua Y,22,Jan 2015,December 2014,50,Fantastic for history buffs,"Free admission but 2 exhibits are closed. Nevertheless we spend about 4 to 5 hours in it. Great for those interested in world and Asian history, but not much to do for young kids.<br/><br/>Try to go for the free tours - just visit their website. We weren't able to do it because we went during the holidays (Dec 20 - Jan 3)"
Garth68,26,Jan 2015,December 2014,50,Excellent Museum,"We got free admission because they were doing renovations to the museum. If you want to see the whole museum, you may want to wait until the renovations are finished."
random_musings,320,Jan 2015,April 2014,40,Worth a trip,Drop by ACM if you have time - located near Raffles Place on the bank of Singapore River. Very well maintained
Journ3yful,20,Dec 2014,November 2014,40,Great way to spend the afternoon,The museum is a very pleasant way to spend the afternoon.  The exhibits are well manicured.  It's not a very big museum so you can get through it in a couple of hours.
MLY18,62,Dec 2014,December 2014,40,Fascinating,"At the moment entry to the museum is free as it is being renovated. It was still fascinating to learn about the history of Singapore river, to learn about cultures such as the Dayaks, and the history of old Chinese merchants , Indian money lenders."
KGB777,"38,048",Dec 2014,NA,40,Some impressive exhibits,Beautiful old building and some impressive displays inside. Not too much to keep young children entertained and some galleries seem to be closed at present for renovation. The exhibition on the history of the Singapore river was interesting as were the various exhibits relating to Indian civilisation.
Verity203,58,Dec 2014,December 2014,40,You need time to make the most of this museum,"So much to see and take in, this museum is worth a visit but be prepared to spend at least a morning going round. A huge amount of information to take in. It's also blissfully cool!"
Rene D,54,Dec 2014,October 2014,40,The must see Museum in Singapore,"To understand where Singapore is now as a country, you must visit this museum.   Right in the City Center, you should spend half a day in this museum."
Neko T,58,Dec 2014,August 2014,40,A museum with interesting asian pieces and culture,"This is the only museum which is outside the museums area in which all the other museums are. Because of that it is not as well known, but I liked this museum a lot due to the permanent exhibitions that they have as well as the kind of exhibitions they bring in."
919DISAPPOINTEDGUEST,"1,004",Dec 2014,March 2014,50,Comprehensive Museum,"A well maintained museum with relics of South East Asia collected to showcase the history of these areas.<br/><br/>A Peranakan section has been carefully preserved and presented to the public whereby it is intermarriage of the local Malays women and scholarly males of Chinese heritage.  In early days Peranakan families are rich and very good cooks with their spicy and non spicy Peranakan dishes namely Ayam Buah Keluak, Chap Chye vegetables.<br/><br/>A short walk away from the Museum you will be able to enjoy the Singapore River with Sir Stamford Raffles Statue for a good photoshoot.<br/><br/>The Asian Civilisations Museum is a great monument in itself and the photoshoot will speak for itself."
Kate P,16,Dec 2014,NA,40,Don't go while been renovated (now),This museum has a big variety of artifacts. No interactive displays though so I wouldn't take children. They are currently doing renovations so alot is closed off. The entry was free while renovations are happening though so that was good.  And the free tours at 11 am and 2pm are definatly a must do :)
Tony W,22,Dec 2014,December 2014,40,Overall good.,"If you want to know more about Asian tribal life in the past you should go there. Very easy to find this museum, just 5 mins walk from Raffles Place MRT station."

simplyCarol396,379,Dec 2014,November 2014,50,"Vast collection, splendid galleries and the best Museum in Singapore!","Among the museums in Singapore this the museum that impressed me much! It's definitely the best museum I've ever seen so far!  <br/><br/>ACM is located along the historical riverside of Singapore. The building being a national monument is an attraction itself even without seeing what it all contain inside. You''ll be fascinated by  its external magnificence and once you get inside,  your fascination will be doubled by how large the place is, the collection and the gallery displays. Everything is definitely jaw dropping! <br/><br/>The collection came from different countries in Southeast Asia. The extinction and history represented by each pieces speaks volume of our ancestors glorious past and culture.<br/><br/>The entrance fee is S$8 for adult and truly worth it. You should at least devote 4 hours to fully enjoy the whole museum. If you're a museum enthusiast, don't forget to bring your camera because they allow visitors to take photos.  To get there, ride MRT and go down at Raffles Station and walk up to 5 minutes to reach ACM. Or during river cruise just tell the boatman to drop you off  to Raffles landing place. It's easy to locate since it is located along the riverside. Opening hours is from 10 am to 7 pm. Avail their free guided tour to fully enjoy your museum tour."
LFSingapore,551,Dec 2014,August 2014,50,Well worth visiting,"For some reason many visitors bypass a trip to this particular museum ..... yet they miss out on so much!<br/><br/>Please make sure this museum is on your list of ""must see"" in Singapore. You will not be disappointed.  There is much to see in all area's of the museum and various items on display are priceless."
Camelgirl43,166,Dec 2014,November 2014,40,Good Museum,"This is a very good museum in an interesting area, so it's nice to have a wander before you go in or when you leave.  They provided a one hour tour which we always find helpful in any museum which doesn't have headsets to rent.  We walked from this museum over to another awesome Singapore experience, Lau Pa Sat, a huge renovated old building that's now a food hall. But that's for another review!"
CraftBeerHunter,123,Dec 2014,November 2014,40,Mainly artifacts,"Our feet were worn out by the time we reached this fairly small museum, so we rather rushed through the large number of cultural artifacts.  The textiles are quite impressive."
Suzibeaton,794,Dec 2014,October 2014,40,Defo worth a visit,We got a free ticket for here with our hop on hop off bus ticket.

Defo worth a visit.
JGeiss,246,Dec 2014,November 2014,50,The best museum we visited,Very good display of Singapore historical artifacts and chronology.  It is an older building near the Singapore River across from the mega structures of the financial downtown.  There was an exhibit of porcelain in house during our visit.
JKH777,60,Dec 2014,November 2014,40,well worth the visit,nice museum. They had an English guided tour at 1100. Take it as it provides more insight. The building is impressive and located right downtown. The ice cream guy outside is the best buy in Singapore!
William F,512,Dec 2014,November 2014,50,Take the free guided tour,Good overview of what I was to see later in my trip to Asia. I highly recommend the guided tour at 11 AM that helped make sense of it all.

B K,190,Nov 2014,May 2014,50,Fascinating Museum,"I am not a big fan of museums I can usually take them or leave them. Generally I do not plan a lot of museum visits when I travel, My wife brought me here and I was amazed by the range of exhibits and the scope of coverage. I could have done two or more visits here. It covered a number of historical eras and geographic locations but the massive size and beauty of many of the treasures on display were amazing..Worth a visit if you are here in Singapore. Cool stuff in the gift shop also if you want a memento or some gifts.."
Gilliantomlinson,169,Nov 2014,November 2014,50,Interesting and well presented,"I arrived in time for a free guided tour by a very knowledgable volunteer guide. She picked out a few choice exhibits and gave us an in-depth insight into these pieces. I then returned after lunch for a leisurely wander around the rest of the museum.  You gain a good insight into the diverse cultures around Singapore, and the influence they have had on the Republic.Some very interesting displays and, as you would expect in Singapore,  it is all beautifully presented and well laid out."
backpacker31,"5,287",Nov 2014,November 2014,40,Asia's Artistic Heritage,"This sprawling museum is housed in one of Singapore's oldest and grandest buildings - the former Empress Place Building (that has since undergone a major restoration). The museum traces the artistic history (and subsequent contributions) of Asia from India to Thailand, Vietnam to Indonesia, China to Cambodia and just about everywhere inside Southeast Asia. From textiles to jewelry and weapons to tableware and religious artifacts. There is so much to see and absorb, not to mention the special exhibit on Chinese porcelain. The exhibits are well laid out and the descriptions are excellent. There are several interactive exhibits which are quite educational. I spent almost four hours here and could have spent longer. My advice would be to break up the visit with lunch nearby as the entry is good all day in/out."
Rachmafe,210,Nov 2014,August 2014,30,Nice Buiding,I just like to see the building cause it's have nice architecture. It's near to other historical building.
NomadNorth,446,Nov 2014,NA,40,Worth a visit,- An interesting exhibit of Asian artifacts. The price is also reasonable. <br/><br/>- Overall signage is good. <br/><br/>- When I went it wasn't very busy.<br/><br/>- Some good interactive video screens.  <br/><br/>- current porcelain exhibition is good but the other Asian artifacts are better. <br/><br/>Cons<br/>- The washrooms are in the lower level which is virtually  in the dark. They need to fix this. I can't imagine a woman alone heading down there. <br/><br/>- Pretty basic gift shop
HONGJIW,7,Nov 2014,November 2014,50,good exhibition,"there are good collections in this museum. I could see the over all pictures of Asia and singapore. it is every to go by MRT, Raffle place station. beautiful building"
AnnLeedsLeeds,33,Nov 2014,November 2014,40,The best museum in Singapore,"If you can visit only one museum in Singapore, visit this one.  In any case, some of the other museums are a bit disappointing.  Some galleries were closed,  but there were magnificent exhibits from Burma, Thailand and Vietnam and the Batak people.  When I visited, there was an excellent exhibition called ""China Mania"" with beautiful porcelain.  Like so many galleries, however, the bookshop did not have a book specifically on highlights in the gallery.  So many galleries fail in this respect because people want a book about what they have seen."
Glen K,2,Nov 2014,October 2014,50,Asian Civilisations,Love the art and history.  Especially loved the Chinese display.  Was great learning about the historical progression of Singapore and learning about the different cultures within Singapore.

Being under the purview of the National Heritage Board, it is usually free to enter during certain holidays so watch out for those! You can check their website for more details of when this happens. Also, it is free on Friday evening, I believe starting 6PM til closing.<br/><br/>Like I said, AWESOME!"
DiggerDeals,113,Nov 2014,November 2014,40,Great Museum,This great museum is worth a visit and plan to spend about 2 hours.  The well crafted and presented exhibits give a wonderful view of Malay and Straits Settlements history over hundreds of years.

Anup M,78,Nov 2014,December 2013,40,Good collection,"The museum itself is a greatly preserved heritage building and it houses many artifacts from the region.

Kat H,135,Nov 2014,October 2014,40,Great Museum,"For history livers there are some fantastic permanent exhibits. Much more extensive than I expected. China Mania exhibit was outstanding.<br/>Lots of school children visit, so if that worries you go out of school hours.<br/>You can easily wander around for hours... My only negative would be that the lighting of some areas and artefacts is pretty average.....the lights need pointing on the exhibits so that you can actually see them!"

The guard had to ""thow us out"" (more like an invitation to return tomorrow) as we wandered around until the last minute..."
Krsna54,96,Nov 2014,October 2014,40,Great Asian Artifacts,You should hang around for long in there to really understand the beauty of our past civilizations. Some of the exihibits are truly astounding. Children may get bored but adults who truly care for history it's a must visit.
Sparkian,99,Nov 2014,November 2014,40,Take the tours!,"The museum is fairly small and doable in a couple of hours, although I'd advise taking the free tours (included with admission price) and spending a little longer. Some of the artefacts are really beautiful, and the text guides along the way are interesting and helpful to understand the importance of the collection.<br/><br/>Might be best to go outside school hours, we had a large class field trip making a lot of noise."
ckal0916,26,Nov 2014,November 2014,50,A big surprise,This well organised museum with well chosen exhibits from all over Asia is well worth a visit. Some of the porcelain in particular is mouth wateringly beautiful. This is a museum for adults though - it is not a museum for children - leave them in the play area.
Ruth H,10,Nov 2014,November 2014,50,Excellent Museum,Very informative. Many interesting displays. Ŵell worth a visit. No refreshments available (due to refurbishment?) but pleasant and cool environment.
AnnabelleLam,54,Nov 2014,September 2014,30,Lovely place to spend the evening,Visited the museum on a Friday night to unwind for the weekend and find the place very calming with quite a lot of displays. I am more intrigued by the displays from China rather than the bamboo sticks from Indonesia region. It has 3 floors and some of the items come with video explanation if you have the interest to explore further. But the lighting in the museum should be brighter as I struggled at times to look at the details of the displays.
dotty16,52,Nov 2014,October 2014,40,Musuem to visit,"This was not on our list, but as we had time we went to visit. It was very interesting and learnt a lot about the history of Singapore. There are lots of very nice displays.  Also in each section there is a video that goes into detail about each area."
Chris Backe @ WorthyGo,181,Nov 2014,October 2014,30,"Meh... Beautiful, but far from comprehensive","Whoever did the lighting here deserves a raise. Whoever neglected to think about the layout of the exhibits deserves a pink slip. Whoever made a museum of Asian civilizations and forgot about Korea and Japan deserves to never work in the industry again.<br/><br/>The three-floor museum features tons of exhibits, plenty of gorgeous items from the past, and a borderline overwhelming amount of information on display. It's all in English (and excellent English, too), but you'll probably tire of reading every panel a half-hour in.<br/><br/>The layout remains confusing, however. At a minimum, some arrows on the floor would assist in guiding people through the optimal route. Instead, you have signage directing you most every which way.<br/><br/>If you're a history nerd, the $8 Singapore dollars is worth it. For me? Meh. I'd probably have gone somewhere else. Give it two hours to ensure you see it all."
Annick J,3,Oct 2014,October 2014,40,Interesting museum,The guided tour is a must if you go to the museum. You can learn a lot if it' 's your first time in Asia
ger3sf,53,Oct 2014,September 2014,40,Enjoyable Visit,"Must see, if in the area. Housed in a refurbished colonial-era building. Enjoyed the history of Singapore and the surrounding region."
571triciac,4,Oct 2014,October 2014,50,A jewel!,"Beautiful displays, well organized, and easy to find your way through. Don't miss this one. Special exhibit was outstanding!"
Daniel P,47,Oct 2014,October 2014,40,To be seen,Beautiful pieces from all over Asia in a sumptuous palace. I would have loved to spend more time to visit it. Worth indeed the visit.
Willy551,69,Oct 2014,September 2014,30,Interesting but,"As museums go, this one needs to rethink its exhibiting policy. The contents are rich and absorbing. Ut apart from the history of Singapore section it's all pretty mundane and standard stuff. Worth the. Is it but don't expect to be bowled over. It needs a whole rethink about modern curatorship."
HoustonCouchPotatoes,89,Oct 2014,October 2014,50,Take a docent-led tour,"This is a spectacular museum.  It has world-quality artifacts and extensive coverage.  You'll want to return.  We took a docent-led tour and were very glad to have done so.  In an hour, she covered highlights and gave us detailed insight."
Alex W,25,Oct 2014,NA,40,Interesting and beautiful,"The art and artifacts in this museum are brilliant, with a wide range of excellent pieces. It presents a side of history not often seen in museums else where in the world especially the whole areas on SE Asian history. That said I was hoping for a but more historical narrative building, but the empires were generally only briefly talked about and never really interworked. Perhaps looking at their ties and relationship with China would be a good way of putting them in a historical context?"
Jane C,172,Oct 2014,February 2014,50,Great Museum,"Make sure you allocate enough time as there is lots to see here!  Exhibitions are of a high standard and there is lots of information available.  Guides are also available.  Keep an eye out for special exhibitions, they are always amazing."
SMLikestoTravel,154,Oct 2014,October 2014,50,Must visit if you are a history buff,I couldn't spend as much time as I wanted here because we had other places to cover as well that day. We spent 2 hours here. Very interesting exhibits and very good information provided for them as well. I liked reading the history of Singapore river the most. The history of porcelain art was also very informative and interesting.
danteskyhigh,25,Oct 2014,July 2014,40,"More precisely a ""South East Asia"" museum","You have to walk quite a bit to reach the ACM, though it could be enjoyable as the museum is in a nice area with plenty attractions.<br/><br/>Exhibitions of each culture is quite thorough, from daily items to religious ones. I acquired much better knowledge on Malacca cultures after the visit. However it is clear that these are the cultures with strong presence within South East Asia, meaning: almost no Japanese, Korean, Mongol, Central Asian, etc.. We heard that there was a section dedicated to Muslim culture but for some reasons it was not included in our guided tour."
Pjkm1954,14,Oct 2014,October 2014,40,Pick of museums,Very good exhibits. Muslim exhibit was closed. Quite informative regarding the ethnic mix of Singapore. Photography is permitted (no flash).
RobVG,139,Oct 2014,October 2014,30,Interesting,"Interesting but a bit disappointing in the all, not all regions of Asia being covered.  Information on what you are going to see in the museum is not sufficient."
chrisdxuk,51,Oct 2014,October 2014,50,Such variety,This museum covers the whole gambit of Asia and does it well from China to India and across the peoples of the Malacca straits. I especially enjoyed the Indian gallery and artworks on display
Marie M,361,Oct 2014,October 2014,50,Engaging docent tour enthralled us!,"Enjoyed a marvelous docent tour today and learned the maritime monsoon trade routes from a 1000 years ago. The walk took us through the Southeast Asia, China, and Indian culture galleries.  We learned about Buddha sculptures from Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar.  Filial piety and other Confucian values are seen through the incredible Chinese artefacts.  There is even a landscape painting by the last Emperor's cousin Pu Ru!  We even saw the wooden Nia tribe ancestor statues whose internal hollows contain the last breath of their relatives!  wow!"
JohnCrost,11,Oct 2014,October 2014,50,Interesting history,Well documented history of Singapore and Asia. We spent 3 hours there. Headed to boat quay to enjoy the sights.
elleirbag,26,Oct 2014,NA,50,A top museum!,"I loved the Asian Civilisations Museum. It is well presented and interesting without being too long. It is as good as any museum in London, Paris or Hong Kong."
Erwin K,"1,964",Oct 2014,September 2014,40,Informative and well presented,"Visited some of Singapore's museums recently , and clearly the Asian Civilization Museum by par is head to head with the National Museum of Singapore ,in our opinion.<br/>Nearest MRT station is Raffles Place or Esplanade , a few minutes walk you would reach the museum ,beside the Singapore River.<br/>Entry fee is SGD 8 , a lot of Asian originated artifacts could be seen in this 4 storeys building.<br/>One of the best museum in Singapore , well worth a visit !"
lifeoftravel,146,Oct 2014,October 2014,40,Affordable and interesting Asian history piece,"The museum, albeit not on the large size, was recommended by local Singaporeans as being interesting about the history of Asia - and it was. It covers many periods and the collection is very well curated and presented. Whilst it wasn't my key area of interest, I certainly learnt alot and the stories are fascinating. The current exhibit, Chinamania is about porcelain and ceramics. This may sound boring (I was sceptical) it was actually quite interesting and told you alot about the history through the ages of various parts of Asia. Nicely presented, a great kids space, air-conditioned and only $8 for entry (adults), $4 for seniors. Walk across to Fullerton to get a cab out. Lockers were only 20cents for a small locker which fitted a very large and heavy handbag."
Seattle_Traveler,194,Oct 2014,September 2014,40,Informative museum in a nice building,We spent two hours touring the museum and found it interesting. Joined a live group for part of the tour and did some via the audio program. Learned a bit about the history and the people -- all new for me.
TheCityHunter,21,Oct 2014,September 2014,30,Cheap way to learn something about Singapore,"Went through there for a stroll and a look.<br/>Most of the exhibits are what you can expect.<br/>Seeing the change in Singapore, specially the bridges, was interesting. As this is the area the Museum is in, you really get a sense of the change.<br/><br/>Otherwise, your standard era related stuff. It doesn't really come to life, and you'd probably want a tour if this is something that really interests you.<br/><br/>Also the only Museum I have ever been that has an interactive touch screen that not only tries to draw your attention by whistling the whole time (which get's creepy in certain sections). It's also so loud, every other visitor on the same floor can hear it, and can't really appreciate it."
313globetrotter,432,Oct 2014,October 2014,40,"ASIAN CIVILISATIONS MUSEUM, SINGAPORE",LIKED:<br/>1)Good range of display<br/>2)Good layout and lightings<br/>3)Good location<br/>Disliked:<br/>1)Poor direction signs<br/>2)Poor location of lifts<br/>3)Entrance price high
sanbikinoraion,56,Oct 2014,August 2014,30,Some gems amongst the stuff,"There are a couple of nice themed exhibitions that provide some decent context along with the exhibits themselves, but there are also room and rooms of barely-labelled ""stuff""."
Whyallagirl,59,Sep 2014,July 2014,40,Fascinating to learn of the blend of cultures,"Displays had interesting details on all the various cultural influences on pre Raffles Singapore, with many items demonstrating the various aspects of daily life from cooking, clothing, work and rituals.<br/>I was disappointed the cafe was an empty space, I would have loved a coffee and a sit down. The museum shop was very small and stock seemed a bit limited to things for school age or the very young"
missmorven,125,Sep 2014,September 2014,40,Informative museum,Reasonable entry fee and lots of interesting information.<br/>There is a lot of reading in the exhibition but some useful points about the Singapore history and without any obvious political or colonial / anti colonial slant
Richarocks,454,Sep 2014,March 2014,50,Gorgeous setting. Do make time for it,Absolutely beuatiful mueseuam with very interesting exhibits. Gorgeous setting and a great place to visit followed by dinner at Indochine.
Cristian S,7,Sep 2014,NA,40,Great exhibitions,"The museum has great and well maintained exhibitions.<br/><br/>The layout and presentation are more thematic and less chronological. Except for the Singapore gallery, the museum does not attempt to present a coherent timeline of how Asia came together but rather demonstrate the diverse and rich Asian cultures."
djmontano,996,Sep 2014,NA,40,Quite remarkable,This historical building houses beautiful exhibits that traverse Singapore's history. It's a great way to learn about the city's colonial past as well as see some remarkable Chinese artifacts.
Anne-Maree S,35,Sep 2014,September 2014,50,Worth seeing,Beautiful building and very good exhibits. You can buy a double pass to this museum and the excellent Peranakan Museum on same day. Very helpful staff. A very nice gentleman who was finishing work walked us to the next museum and even gave us advice on where to have lunch - we had a great laksa thanks to him.
JimmyTraveler2014,147,Sep 2014,February 2014,50,Very well curated museum,"During 2014 Chinese New Year, I visited my parents' home in mainland China.  As a family, we watched a documentary about the treasure ship during Ming Dynasty that sunk near Southeast Asian sea.  Later on, people found the sunken ship along with its 50000+ pieces of China.  And they house the find at this very museum.  During this visit, I made sure that I visited this museum for this find.<br/><br/>It was a wonderful visit, and the museum was very well designed, laid out, well curated, and well lit.  Many wonderours treasures were on exhibtion.<br/><br/>I found the few pieces out of the 50000+ Chinaware, and it was wonderful.<br/><br/>The time was well spent.  The place is very handicap friendly, and have clean bathroom facilities throughout the place.<br/><br/>Highly recommend!"
GlobalHarmony,51,Sep 2014,June 2014,40,Wonderful Experience,I didn't know what to expect but I had nothing to worry about. The museum is very well-organised. The facilities are excellent.<br/><br/>I enjoyed my visit very much and I would recommend it to any traveller to Singapore looking for a little more than the 'mass' museum offering. There are many details here for those willing to spend time familiarising themselves with Asian history. A worthwhile visit.
Ian569,44,Sep 2014,September 2014,40,Some interesting exhibits,"A good mixture of artifacts from Asia, which are worth a visit.<br/><br/>However considering the wealth of Singapore I would have hoped that the museum could have been better. It is ok but I think you have to consider how little has been spent over the last 30 years on procuring exhibits and developing the building!"
WJ912001,279,Sep 2014,September 2014,50,Better than the National Museum,"Take the 1 hour guided tour conducted by volunteers -- they are passionate and knowledgeable and the tour is a great introduction into to the museum history, layout and key pieces. Although the museum is small, it is carefully curated with excellent descriptions/explanations. The special exhibition, China Mania (the porcelain, not the country), was very interesting with wonderful storytelling."
laced,99,Sep 2014,August 2014,50,Well worth a visit!,We have visited Singapore many times and even walked past this museum! we are very pleased that this time we went to view the museum and its collections. We easily spent 3 hours gaining insight into the development of this wonderful city and country. Many of the displays brought back memories of the short time we lived in Singapore during the late 1970's. Singapore was a far different place then compared to the vibrant city it is today.
Iamalwayslost,514,Sep 2014,February 2014,50,Beautiful Museum at a Beautiful Site,There are many museums of Asian Civilization but this one stands out among all of them.  Their permanent collection takes you step by step trip through history in a very unique and novel way.  Their special shows are always innovative and exciting to see.  This museum is one of my first stops when I visit Singapore.
Fiohnel F,61,Sep 2014,September 2014,40,"Excellent curation of artefacts, but you'll only learn little.","The renovated colonial-era building has ample space, modern interior, clean and cool air-conditioned. Good place to escape Singapore's heat at noon. Despite of the pan-Asian label, it has little or no information about East Asia (Japan, Korea), and the West Asia room was under renovation when I visited.<br/><br/>They showcase mostly artefacts like statues, vases, and jewelries in glass cases, with minimum text explanation and poor interactive audiovisual guides (there's one at first floor that ask you to insert ticket to the machine, but you don't receive any and other guides work just fine). It has rather amazing curation or artefacts, but in the end it feels rather sterile and shallow. So I recommended to take the volunteer English-speaking guide (starting hour at 11AM and 2PM for weekdays; call them for more details) to provide you with context that you can't get just from strolling--even if the volunteer guide won't cover every rooms."
New-Flying-Dutchman,199,Sep 2014,NA,50,Such a beautiful museum!,This museum is one of the most beautiful in south-east Asia. Not only because it describes many different cultures of south-east Asia. It also has many splendid things on display. A very nice museum to wander around and enjoy all the beauty inside this temple of art.
Kunal A,50,Sep 2014,October 2013,40,A good look into the past,Interesting place which gives you a good look into the early days of the city and the people who built it. If your into that kind off things then must visit. Spare 2-3 hours at least for this place.
Gillian B,22,Sep 2014,September 2014,50,Culture,We took the guided tour as the museum is large and has so many exhibits or we just wouldn't have got round it. It's very interesting and well worth a visit
Donna T,365,Sep 2014,September 2014,30,So so,Not too bad. We decided to do the tour and I wished we hadn't.  The guide was nice enough but her focus was on China Mania. I found that side of it quite boring. I wish we had walked around at our own leisure
Maria Jose L,493,Sep 2014,August 2014,40,KNOWING THE PAST,"Quiet place where you can learn about the culture and history of Asia, this perfectly maintained, explained, the lighting is perfect. On hot days is a good time to visit."
maguscanook,101,Sep 2014,September 2014,50,Special display on right now-China Mania,"An absolute must to gain snap-shot of Singapore history. Like every place in Singapore it is spotlessly clean and inviting. Right now, ChinaMania, ""The Global Passion for Porcelain"" is on display and will remain until December 14/14. The entire museum is spectacular and well worth your time. Gorgeous ancient textiles, costumes, artifacts alongside truly fabulous porcelain. Lovely!"
SkyKing23,152,Sep 2014,September 2014,30,Typical Museum,"I'm not a big museum person, but this one was ok. It gave some interesting background; the problem is, Singapore doesn't have a lot of its own history, since it's a relatively new country. It did have some displays on different foods and clothing, and a room that displayed a bed that people would lay on when they died. It's not bad, but I would only go if I was really into Asian history or if I was on an extended trip to Singapore; I wouldn't prioritize it for a short visit."
Kabayan a,99,Sep 2014,September 2014,40,Not a BIG museum but must see,"Asian Civilisations Museum is not a BIG HUGE museum like you will find in the western countries. I have visited many many museum in many cities. This ACM is unique. small, but very focus on early civilisation in Asia. The museum is very well manage, well organize and the descriptions are good.<br/>Maybe, for you that are not from Asia, I suggest to take a tour to get the most of this museum.<br/><br/>In some part of the museum, was quite dark.<br/><br/>The only weakness of this museum, they do not have taxi stand. We had to cross the bridge and queued at Fullerton Hotel, that was not preferred by hotel guests.<br/><br/>thanks and enjoy the museum"
cajunnsw,164,Sep 2014,August 2014,40,Take the tour,Free tours on the hour.  Very informative and plenty to see.  One of the hop on hop off buses (we left from the flyer) stop very near this museum.  We saw an exhibition of Chinese porcelain. The tour guide was excellent.
asiatrip61,151,Sep 2014,July 2014,40,Interesting Museum near Raffles place,"Near the busy Raffles Place (only during week day), you will find this old building full of charm. It was one of my first visit when I came in Singapore 10 years ago. They have a lot to show. You can understand more about asian civilization. Not sure the kids will like this place."
Pierre T,10,Sep 2014,May 2014,40,Very interesting,"Well documented and organised museum. There are many sections covering a very wide range of subject, so yo may want to visit it more than once: for me it was a bit too much to try and do it all in a single visit, but I enjoyed it. It may be a good idea to join a guided tour? Fascinating expo of pictures of historical Singapore."
Steve B,64,Sep 2014,August 2014,40,Culture,For someone lacking in culture this was really interesting. We were here during the Chinamania which was a really exceptional exhibit. Overall the exhibits were fascinating and the displays of china was really quite amazing. To be inches away from artefacts dating back hundreds of years was amazing. Only issue we found was that some of the display explanations were hard to read due to the lighting.
ViandeFumee,61,Aug 2014,May 2014,40,Most of South-East Asia in one place,"Very good place to stop by for a couple of hours.  The ACM is jam-packed with artefacts and relics and interactive exhibits on South-East asian cultures such as Khmer, Vietnamese, Indian, Chinese, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and so on and so forth.  I was actually a bit surprised that the ACM held so much and was so educational."
Archanbarua,66,Aug 2014,September 2013,40,Need Time,you need time to see this around. do not hurry else you will miss the essence of the place. anyone who has interest in trivia and history should pay a visit. kids may not like except that open spaces to run around!
subzy,62,Aug 2014,August 2014,40,Beautiful and enjoyable,"We took our two sons aged 9 and 12 to this museum. Not sure why but it was almost empty when we arrived around midday. The museum is set over two floors and sadly two halls were closed for refurbishment.  We learnt a great deal about Singapore and its surrounding countries.  The artefacts are well presented with placards in English. There are some interactive screens too, though they were a bit long winded. We spent around 1 and a half hour there and managed to see it all. The museum was very clean and air conditioned. It's located near the quay too so it's well worth seeing if you're in the area."
Sam H,128,Aug 2014,February 2014,40,Much more interesting than expected,"The Asian Civilisations Museum is relatively small, although much larger than the grotty old one off Orchard Road.  It has a very well put together collection and is worth a visit.  The whole thing will take an hour, and you can reward yourself with a refreshing drink along Boat Quay afterwards."
Oiane S,196,Aug 2014,August 2014,50,Intense visit,"Well curated, many pieces on show.Missed an audioguide but many explanation pannels. Worth the visit to make an idea of the history."
Kartika Chika,36,Aug 2014,August 2014,30,okay,"the place is okay to walk around but the weather so hot at that time, lucky didn't come there at the weekend so less people and very quite"
theimmc,102,Aug 2014,August 2014,50,A quiet and interesting museum in a busy area,"Located in a beautiful historic building just outside the financial district, this museum has some rather interesting exhibits. Among the many exhibits showing various aspects of Asian civilization, there is also one small section for pre-colonial and colonial Singapore that I found fascinating, but wish was larger. Other permanent exhibits include India, China, and South East Asia.<br/><br/>The building layout is a little confusing, as it was used for government offices in its previous life and not designed to be a museum from the beginning. There are video monitors at many stations that give more background regarding certain topics. I've been here a few times and never found this place to be crowded. Photography without flash is allowed. Many galleries are quite dark, however, so you may need to crank up your ISO. The staff are friendly. While I wouldn't put this under ""must see"" for anyone's to-do list in Singapore, I definitely recommend it, it is certainly a nice way to spend a few hours away from the crowds.<br/><br/>There appeared to be some construction going on when we were there, it seems like the building is being expanded.<br/><br/>Admission is free for residents (some special exhibits may require a fee) and quite inexpensive for non residents - compared to most things in Singapore."
TheReids,275,Aug 2014,August 2014,30,a good smattering,"It's difficult to be fair about the museum: it was well laid out, a good representation of artifacts but we've seen most of the displays indepth in museums in their own countries so I am not sure how exciting it would be to people where this is their first encounter of these items (like, for example, the dagger hilt of a turkish dagger from Topaki Palace).  It was certainly an interesting way to spend an hour or two."
RMartinL101,149,Aug 2014,October 2013,50,Excellent Introduction to local cultures,Organised by Asian cultures and very interesting to see differences. Good introduction to history of Singapore and its various peoples.
cc_1949,81,Aug 2014,August 2014,50,Exciting,"One of the best museums I have ever visited. The presentation is very well organised. Documents, pictures and all other items are perfectly described.<br/>You can enjoy the evolution and the differences of Asian cultures."
Silverlucky,93,Aug 2014,March 2014,50,A view of Asian Civilisations history - not at all boring,"I loved (a) the location of this Museum - very close to city/shopping/dining areas, (b) the fact that I can enjoy learning something about Asian civilisations from the very nicely displayed artifacts, written information boards and both audio and visual presentations available, (c) to be able to freely wander at my own pace in this Museum.<br/>Above all, it is a wonderful experience to be able to visit Singapore, enjoy all the modern-day amendities, facilities, attractions for sight-seeing, and to have a place to go to learn about its past history, the peoples who came decades ago to help build up villages, cities and towns to what they have become today.<br/>Totally not boring ! Actually, a great learning place to go to to escape the heat of the day, or to go to on a wet and rainy afternoon. Also ideal way to keep the young informed of past ages."
S T,294,Aug 2014,August 2014,50,Asian Civilisations Museum,"An excellent collection, well displayed and interpreted. It's also not so huge that you feel you have to rush round. I did the guided tour (free) which was great. Perhaps not ideal for young children."
Donny J,39,Aug 2014,April 2014,40,Asian history in a glance,"If you visit Singapore, then this place surely is one of the many places that you should've visited. There is a fee but not much and quite worthy for what inside. <br/><br/>The place is not very difficult to be found and once inside you have many brochures to accompany you. <br/><br/>The place was well structured. So you will find an exhibition of history items and goods in manner of each civilization. In other words, you won't find Middle East material in Far East section. <br/><br/>The place was very good for examining the exhibited items, however since the lamination inside of the premise was quite or very dim, you might need very good camera. Even at some sections, you're not allowed by the guard to take the picture. So much with your selfie then...<br/><br/>This place is good to spend little time should you have no other places to be visited in Singapore."
trapperphil44,98,Aug 2014,August 2014,40,A good display of local History,Well set out display of Singapore's early history. All aspects of Stamford Raffles vision and accomplishments where covered together with the ethnic mix of original settlers.
George W,141,Aug 2014,July 2014,40,A first time must see,If this is your first time to Singapore then you have to see this museum to appreciate the history. Also do the nighttime bicycle tour of Chinatown
Ms Cas,47,Aug 2014,NA,50,Loved it :),"A highlight of my stay in Singapore, I spent hours wandering around this beautiful and fascinating museum. The displays are gorgeous, informative and really well presented. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a quiet and pleasant retreat from the heat, then I highly recommend the Asian Civilisations Museum. I look forward to returning."
Shibu A,20,Aug 2014,July 2014,40,Too Good for  Students,"My  son and my self really  enjoyed this museum really  educative and informative  , Chola bronze sculpture of Uma, consort of Shiva and that of Somaskanda hailing from the Mathura and Gandhara schools.Ancient Southeast Asia are Khmer sculptures, Javanese temple sculpture are rare specimens."
CaseyOng2014,954,Aug 2014,March 2014,40,"Dude, it's a museum","I am into museums. Excellent. Photographs allowed but no flashes. Well, that's the rule in most museums."
Alex P,32,Aug 2014,July 2014,30,Average,This place was undergoing renovations when we were there so we werent really expecting that. There were very few facilities for disabled people.
LaurelGrace,10,Aug 2014,August 2014,40,Favorite Museum in Singapore!,"We absolutely loved this museum! It was a beautiful space filled with loads of information about Asia. Unfortunately, the West Asian exhibits were not open due to renovations, but we still were able to spend a couple of hours there!"
lalehgomari,105,Aug 2014,June 2014,30,Great escape from the midday heat,"If you are around the area and want to avoid the scorching sun, head to this museum. It's good that they managed to put together a collection of some of Asia's treasure but don't expect a Louvre!"
Vallepalli,42,Jul 2014,July 2014,50,Lovely!,Beautiful museum in a gorgeous old building.  We loved all the exhibits and spent about 2 hours here with our 9 year old son.  The exhibits are visually very appealing.  Great!
Chua Y,1,Jul 2014,July 2014,30,Good museum but unhelpful staff,"I brought my friends who were visiting from the UK to visit the museum, which they found interesting. The big downside was how inflexible the staff were. When I asked politely whether I could use a power socket to charge my phone as I need to meet two other people later in the afternoon, they looked at their desks at the reception and said that they didn't have any spare. So I pointed to the unused ones along the wall next to the stairs and asked if I could use those. The security guard at the reception said 'no one look after for you you know'. I said I can wait while it charges, until the point where it switches on and I am able to text my friends. Then another reason appeared - 'cannot do that if not they will come and catch you'. I am not sure who 'they' are. I pleaded again, explaining that I hadn't arranged with my friends about where to meet, so I really needed to call them to let them know where I am. And then staff A looked at staff B, after a good 5 seconds, staff B said no cannot. This was followed by a chorus of 'no cannot' by staff A, B and C. Perhaps the staff could have been more helpful and flexible."
Douglas P,110,Jul 2014,March 2014,50,Very good museum to visit,"Very good museum to visit, I was there and that day is open house day! Free of charge the tickets. Good museum to visit anyway, take a look around if you have time in Singapore."
DexterChris,8,Jul 2014,July 2014,30,Asian history,Interesting if you enjoy Asian history. I personally found the static historical pieces boring and not engaging after awhile. Could the museum be more interactive to engage the viewers?
Chelsea L,9,Jul 2014,July 2014,50,A must for all!,"If you are interested in Asian history and culture, this is a place you shouldn't miss! The exhibitions are well-organized, and they MANY beautiful artifacts. It can give you a thorough look inside the life surrounding countries, nations. This is definitely one of the nicer history museums I have had the chance of visiting! <br/><br/>There were plenty of things for children to do throughout the museum as well. The museum was very interactive, and I really enjoy that in a museum."
anniegurumi,27,Jul 2014,NA,40,A small but quaint museum,"I personally enjoyed the museum for all the artifacts and explanations. Having a little boy (who is around 14 months old) was no easy task to take him through the museum. But to my delightful surprise - at the end of my trip, there was a lovely play area for him! Beautiful, bold colors and different textures and things for him to play with. It kept him occupied for a good 30 mins. There was even a mini life size maze for him to weave in and out of for another few minutes. <br/><br/>On the weekend, I believe they have a puppet or story telling show. I went on a weekday so my little hug didn't get to see that but he had the play room to himself!<br/><br/>The outside has seats and little swings for you to relax on a nice day. We got a nice cream sandwich for a dollar outside the museum and it was the perfect treat for the day."
Spannng,110,Jul 2014,June 2014,40,Good if your interested in Asian Culture,Was a good way to kill some time while my wife shopped at Orchard Rd. There was an interesting exhibit on the Singapore River. Not a lot of history but rather as the name suggests more about culture.
Hmahendran,143,Jul 2014,May 2014,50,Great overview for Asian History,Go during weekdays when there are guided tours by volunteers. They will point out the few highlights of the museum. The tours are about an hour then you can go back and look at the exhibits that caught your interest in greater detail.
fabio_italian,38,Jul 2014,May 2014,50,The best museum in SG for understanding Asian culture,The best museum in SG for understanding Asian culture.<br/>Every public holiday is also free and there are always free guided tours :)
Travellingirl181,55,Jul 2014,May 2014,50,Take a free tour,We thoroughly enjoyed this attraction and were invited to go on a free tour with one of the guides. This was very well worth it as she had a good background of knowledge about the exhibitions she showed us. Although that was only a small part of the museum it was very interesting
travelm858,153,Jul 2014,July 2014,30,Disappointed this time,Several exhibits were closed ie Islamic section and the lighting was so subdued it was difficult to read any of the information or clearly see the exhibits. My 4th visit here to show my 11 year old what I have always thought to be one of the best museums in Asia.<br/>The best part was the ice cream sandwich man outside the front door.
Cheeps21,367,Jul 2014,July 2014,40,Visit during special festivals,"Among the museums in Singapore, ACM seems to be the least appealing to my young kids.... unless there is a special festival. In recent years, ACM has stepped up their efforts to organize 5-8 festivals a year, coinciding with the opening/closing of a few exhibit and just last weekend, they had the River Nite festival.<br/><br/>ACM exhibits core exhibits has remained unchanged for the last 10-15 years, as the faces in the ""interactive screens"" stars local actors/actresses when they were in their younger days."
shigstar,43,Jul 2014,June 2014,50,Very fascinating museum,"We have been to a few museums in Singapore and this one didn't dissapoint us once again like all the others. Beautifully laid out and organised, it was a very fascinating experience for us. Luckily, as we arrived there, we were told that there will be a guided tour in 10 minutes so we decided to wait. The lady who guided us was so lovely and tooks us around for about an hour. She was a volunteer guide but she had a wealth of knowledge and it was very educational as well. The place had a lot of artefacts from all over Asia and we learnt a lot of different histories and cultures in short time. I would not recommend for family with small children as they would probably get a little bored. On the other hand, if you are interested in history and culture especially Asian history and culture, then you would easily be able to spend hours in this place."
Angelin F,22,Jul 2014,NA,40,Must go here,"It's interesting place where u must going. Not just for a children, but also adult who like history. It's like going to other century!"

hrtraveler,739,Jul 2014,July 2014,50,Fascinating collection,"Well worth the visit if you're in Singapore, this museum does a good job of placing Singapore's history and its peoples in perspective.  The museum itself is well designed, with many accessible exhibits."
Des D,43,Jul 2014,July 2014,40,Interesting,This is a very interesting place to visit. It's up to you whether you read everything that's there or take a listen to all the audio and video tapes. Certainly worth a look

Jessie0172,89,Jul 2014,February 2014,30,Unique museum,"We found this museum to be quiet interesting. However, I don't feel I could spend too long here. The exhibits where amazing and quiet interesting but there wasn't much flow and it could be quiet confusing about what related to what. The restaurant was quiet overpriced as well. But it is in a central location and was only a easy 20min walk from the singapore flyer."
JtGt5755,39,Jul 2014,June 2014,40,Interesting,"Didn't spend much time there, only part of a tour group but enough time to learn about the history of Singapore"
Renee S,11,Jul 2014,April 2014,40,What a learning experience,I loved this museum. It was very easy to navigate and I really felt that I was seeing some very different things. Definetely worth a visit
frannah,87,Jul 2014,July 2014,40,Lots of easily accessible information,I liked the designated areas that took you on a tour of Singapore before delving you into other Asian civilisations' history. This included linking events in Singapore with the surrounding nations and how their histories have over-lapped each other.<br/><br/>Take water as you might find yourself lost in the different histories of the area!
Linda W,340,Jul 2014,July 2014,40,Very interesting,A good museum providing a quick refresher on Asian history classes. Joined a free guided tour and recommend you do this if one is available. Makes it more interesting. A couple of the security guards were a bit noisy talking to each other. Found it strange that the guard on the entry to the galleries made me leave my water bottle outside when I could have had far more dangerous things in my backpack. The annoying thing was that it was only way so had to go back to the start to reclaim my bottle so keep your bottle in your bag as they don't seem to check bags.
102Sarah102,15,Jul 2014,February 2014,40,Excellent for the whole family,"Wonderful galleries - particularly liked the social history stories from South East Asia.  Also has activities sometimes for children, so look online to see if there are things to do that day."
LondonCitytraveller,418,Jul 2014,October 2013,40,Good interesting Museum and its free !,We visited the Museum on a recent trip to Singapore. Had passed it a few times and made it one of our 'must do' events this trip. The museum traces the history of the Island from early times to the present day.  For the history lover there are plenty of interesting exhibits and lots to read.<br/><br/>There are very few gadgets for the kids (few buttons to press but not many) so children will probably get bored easily. <br/><br/>Well set out - different floors have different themes.  The religious artefacts interested me - but watch your head as you step out of the 'log cabin'. There is an opportunity to try your hand at 'bongo' drums in the lifesize tent.<br/><br/>Will probably revisit on our next trip to Singapore.
Infernanda,145,Jun 2014,June 2014,50,A glimpse of some of the Asian peoples.,This is my second favorite museum in S'pore. Very isteresting for showcasing so many different cultures in one building. Well organized and quiet.
Olga K,67,Jun 2014,March 2014,50,A great museum,"The museum has an extensive collection of ""all things Oriental', history and pieces of art of every Asian culture, from China to Sri Lanka complete with a nice little museum shop that sells tshirts with peranakan motives. Definitely worth visiting and re-visiting."
Cesar V,1,Jun 2014,NA,50,Wonderful Collection,"Last year I visited several Asian cities(Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila, Macau) and visited their art museums and did find any museum as good as this one. I was surprised to find such a beautiful and comprehensive collection covering most cultures in South East Asia (Chinese, Indian, Malay, Muslim and some Polynesian). On top of that it covers both anthropological objects from the every day life of these cultures and the art they produced. My only complain was that one of the Galleries devoted to the Muslim world was closed for maintenance."
Lovefoodtravelalot,257,Jun 2014,March 2014,50,Great exhibitions,"Close early usually by 6pm. So go early. <br/>Great exhibition, depending on the season. <br/>Went for Singapore exhibition, interactive and we had headphones and device (in many diff language). It tells us more about the exhibit by pressing number. One pair of earphones and device broke down half way, we panicked a little but fortunately a serviceman was standing by to replace it for us!"
Mosspiglet,144,Jun 2014,June 2014,50,Great museum,I have visited this museum twice now and loved both visits. A good variety of material is on display.
Bojan T,145,Jun 2014,June 2014,40,Easily spent 2 hours,I generally enjoy good museums and this is a good one. It details the Asian civilizations from different perspectives and I particularly loved learning about the lesser known ones. Certain sections kept me captivated for quite a while. We easily spent 2 hours here.
Mary L,188,Jun 2014,June 2014,50,So much history in one museum!,"I spent hours at this lovely museum, browsing well laid out displays of some of the finest art and artifacts and still didn't even scratch the surface. Left with a greater appreciation of the cultures that make up Singapore's rich heritage. Would have loved to stay the entire day."
Rick F,62,Jun 2014,February 2014,50,Best museum we visited in South East Asia,"The museum was huge, with multiple areas displaying different aspects of the main theme.<br/><br/>Great value for money, as we spent a good late morning here there, pushing our lunch back by hours as we didn't want to leave!<br/><br/>Got lunch round at Clarke's Quay afterwards And onwards to Raffles (relatively long walk)"
Natasha P,15,Jun 2014,November 2013,50,History and Pretty things!,Excellent general overview of the main Asian Civilisations accompanied by beautiful artefacts and explanations.
870traveller,37,Jun 2014,June 2014,50,Hermitage du Asie,The Asian civilization Museum is a life view of previous times. How Asia got more industrialliized by European and African influenzes.The artifacts you'll see are really beautifull with moments outdoors at the square for unrush and make ready for a second view of the museum in order to be more satisfied by the items you'll see. just only 8 dollars fee.
bambilovesthumper,50,Jun 2014,June 2014,30,Somewhat dissapointing,"There were some beautiful items on display. The museum is very small, don't expect to spend the morning there. We were the first ones in on a Sunday morning, no queue and I don't think we saw more than 10 visitors while we were there. They have a great kids playroom with 2 lovely pieces on display and lots of things to climb on. The exhibits were very professionally done and the curation was lovely. I did find it a bit dark overall and I couldn't see some of the detail on some of the clothing pieces and sculptures. I would pop-in again, the $8 charge was minor compared to some other Singapore attractions, but you wont need much more than an hour to go through the entire museum."
Hermanshah,197,Jun 2014,NA,40,Decent museum,This is my second time visiting..came here to watch the batak exhibition..<br/>Singaporeans gain free entry..an effort to attract local to museum..just show the i/c and enter for free..<br/>Clean and well maintained museum..<br/>Lotsa artifact to look at..many seating area just in case you need a rest..<br/>Recommended..<br/>But i strongly recommend tourist to go singapore museum instead to know more about singapore history..
ct1978,26,Jun 2014,NA,40,Gorgeous building ,Welcome relief from the heat. <br/>Great building. <br/>Lots of objects to illustrate the cultural heritage of different Asian civilisations. <br/>Lacquer ware outstanding.
Michael656,14,Jun 2014,June 2014,50,Worth a visit,"Asian Civilisations Museum is quite compact, but the artefacts on display are great. Well worth a visit."
Dan M,483,Jun 2014,March 2014,50,Educate yourself!,"I have lived for more than 15 years in Asia, but didn't know how little I knew about Asian civilization until I visited the museum.  <br/><br/>Crammed with artifacts that help to explain how Asia, and Singapore in particular came to be what it is today.   I especially enjoyed the historical films on show. <br/><br/>In short, this is a not to be missed attraction in Singapore for anyone with more than a passing interest in Asia."
AshN,456,Jun 2014,June 2014,50,Must-see attraction,"This museum covers all the civilisations of Asia, particularly the races that live in Singapore and gives a good appreciation of the others. It is a short walk from Clark Quay and well worth your time."
Abdullah W,22,Jun 2014,July 2013,30,Not impressed,"Could have been better. A few interesting artefacts, but a bit too much of the Chinese emphasis and the Mulan stuff instead of the local history which I was hoping to find out more of."
Marilyn A,26,Jun 2014,May 2014,50,dont miss this,well worth a visit make sure you allow a good few hours to really appreciate all it has to offer. One not to be missed
atripwithme,168,Jun 2014,October 2013,40,Museum all for Asia,"I loved the museum and how it is free for Singaporeans. It is an amazing museum with a huge collections of everything around Asia, especially SouthEast Asia, I love the diversity of the place with the ever changing entrance exhibition every 3-6 months. This is a good place to learn more about the cultures, the ethnicities, religions, races, food, traditions and basically everything in a nutshell about SEA before travelling around the region. Singapore happens to be the aviation hub for this region and it sure is useful to visit this place if you got no time for SEA."
Mathieu P,132,Jun 2014,June 2014,40,Nice but a bit small,"The museum displays sole great south (east) asian artifacfs but to be honnest I was expecting something bigger.... But the explanations are very clear, so it is clearly worth a visit."
Karen R,382,Jun 2014,May 2014,50,"If you only have time for one musuem, this one is it.","Okay, you've been to see Merlion and you've just finished your boat ride on the Singapore river, now you owe yourself a visit to the Asian Civilisations Museum since you're in the neighborhood. There's a lot to see there and in 2 hour visit you will only skim the surface, but you'll find so many interesting exhibits that you'll be compelled to return on your next visit to Singapore."
HotMama_Dev,380,May 2014,May 2014,40,great to understand singapore and asia,"Went there with young children for the Secrets of the fallen pagoda exhibition. The kids enjoyed the simple activities sprinkled throughout the exhibition. The rest of the standard exhibits were not too suitable for young children though, but great to spend time in on a gloomy cloudy day."
Dominique L,85,May 2014,March 2014,50,Most interesting,"This museum goes beyond Singapore history and present a rich history of Asia and South East Asia. One will understand the major impacts of the Chinese, Malay, Indian and Arab communities not only in Singapore but in South Asia.<br/>A must see museum which will enrich those interested in the sublime Asia civilization."
Mr_Mrs_Melbourne,295,May 2014,May 2014,40,Excellent for History Buffs.,"Lets be honest, there's not a lot of history left in Singapore, its all been bulldozed to make way for 'progress'.  We enjoy seeing different cultures, but culture is lacking a little in Singapore these days.  The Asian Civilisation Museum is wonderful though and is definately a place worth visiting to see the rich history the Asian region has."
Matthew B,58,May 2014,May 2014,50,Feast for intellectual senses,"Loved the collection, and even the way it was presented to the public. This may be one of the finest museums in Asia, let alone Singapore. Very diverse and thorough curation."
Shane A,4,May 2014,April 2014,50,Worth a visit,Excellent cultural representation of Asia. Great place to visit. Pagoda exhibition was excellent! Enjoyable for kids too.
GlobetrottingFan,115,May 2014,May 2014,40,Interesting cross-section of exhibits,"I spent a rainy afternoon strolling through the various galleries and exhibits at the ACM. Enjoyed the variety, explanatory cards, and optional video clips."
Piya,62,May 2014,June 2013,50,Time well spent here,"if you are a museum enthusiast this place will interest you. The day I visited, a Friday, it was not crowded and we could browse through peacefully through the rooms and various sections of the beautiful museum. The section housing Chinese arts and the section displaying jewellery is fascinating. There is also a fun section where there is a simulated village and the kids love that. Very well maintained museum with clear signs to guide you inside. The staff was helpful aswell. We had left our sunglasses in one of the sections where there are ancient Chinese games. We realized if when we finished the tour and was leaving the museum. The reception desk promptly coordinated with the staff inside and got us back our stuff. I loved the museum and you must take the children here to make history come alive."
fracmeister,540,May 2014,April 2014,50,Definitely worth the trip,"Centrally located, this museum always has some sort of special exhibits to supplement the permanent stuff. It is in an exciting part of Singapore and makes for a pleasant hour or two.  I have gone several times--- great food in the area and lots to see and do."
RyanTYZ,385,May 2014,September 2013,30,A good place to catch up on Asian culture,"A comparatively small museum compared to others in Singapore but adequately informative to share on the different Asian cultures in Singapore.<br/><br/>This place is a big hit with the elderly and young school children in Singapore as they have planned excursions to visit the museum every year.<br/><br/>I would recommend this place to my foreign friends only if they have spare time in Chinatown. If you are doing a layover and only have one day in Singapore, I would recommend you visit our Gardens by the Bay, Clarke Quay, Chinatown and Little India."
StephenSDenver,"1,058",May 2014,March 2014,50,Excellent and informative,Brilliantly organized and informative. You don't need a guide - everything is well signposted. A nice historical perspective of all the different cultures that are part of Singapore explained through priceless artifacts.
Umesh3470,73,May 2014,March 2014,50,Interesting place to visit,I could not go to this place during my last visit hence this time decided to go there. The place gives you you some very good insights about singapore and the life there. A place worth visiting once.
David W,106,May 2014,May 2014,40,religion in the East,"A very pleasant Turkish-born volunteer guide took us round for an introductory hour's tour. She touched on most of the exhibits there as a taster for a longer solo look round, but quite honestly I'd seen enough of religious artefacts by then. Of more interest was the small display of photos of the Singapore river in a separate space on the 1st floor. Impressive building though ... the colonials left behind a superb architectural legacy."
Mark B,142,May 2014,April 2014,50,Best way to learn the history of the island city and the region,"I read several guidebooks but didn't truly have an understanding of Singapore until I spent a few hours in this Museum. I learned about the indigenous people, the growth as a port city, religious influences, colonization,  and urban master plan that made this such an incredible city today. This was by far my favorite attraction in the city."
vcabq,136,May 2014,April 2014,50,Some wonderful pieces,"A very nice collection of asian art, some interesting video displays, very interesting on the whole."
CharlesTheVoyager,56,May 2014,May 2014,50,Love it...,"If you like culture and want to avoid shopping, come here.  Well worth it and so well put together!  We especially liked the ancient part best.  Went on a weekend so quite crowded though..."
bluey_way,447,May 2014,May 2014,40,of course not for those have no interest on history.,"Asian Civilisation Museum is accesible from Raffles Place Mrt by just walking. Free admission for citizen and PR. If you are a work permit holder, you will need to pay Sd8 per pax. <br/><br/>The museum is well-kept and well maintained. Well done. <br/><br/>It covers not only history and development of Singapore especially on Singapore River, you will be exposed to history of Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Arab...etc..I mean across Asia. hehe..<br/>My all-time philosophy is~no harm visit it at least once (Don't just keep enjoy shopping and dining in life,lol :p)."
Mirjam1403,110,May 2014,February 2014,50,Great overview of Asian civilization,"Great sculptures, furniture and artifacts of the different Asian regions. I particularly liked the special exhibition on the stone Chinese army when I visited the museum at the end of 2011. Every time I go back to Singapore this museum is on my list. In the evening the IndoChine restaurant next door is also a great experience!"
Judith B,25,May 2014,April 2014,40,Informative,"Great explanations on Asian History, in particular to the cultures which make up Singaporeans.   I was lucky to see a visiting exhibition of the Secrets of the Fallen Pagoda.  The whole museum is very easy to follow but you have to have time to go round it all."
qqravelle,116,May 2014,April 2014,40,my favourite museum in SG,"very informative and interactive museum, well-organised into the various cultures of asia. especially love its special exhibitions.. very well curated"
Tessaho,141,May 2014,May 2014,50,Essential visit to delve into Singapore as the cross roads of Asian influences,"This is a surprisingly erudite collection of various valuable and interesting artefacts and beautiful arts and crafts gathered over 2000 years from Cambodia, Vietnam, China and India. A free one hour tour from a lovely Argentinian guide who was extremely knowledgeable and clearly loved the art objects was a perfect introduction to a carefully curated collection. Well worth the visit."
khmersrei,229,May 2014,April 2014,50,Excellent collection,"This is a great museum, strong focus on Malay and Indonesian cultures, the lighting in the gallery which has the Angkor sculptures and other features is rather dim, but overall this collection is excellent. It doesn't have the scope of the San Francisco one, but has some well executed Indian and Chinese galleries and a superb collection of Malay and Peranakan exhibits."
dancingfeetManila,314,May 2014,April 2014,40,Wonderful,"Not your boring museum especially if you can join the free Engligh tour. We got a great tour guide, really gave  fascinating talk about Asian civilization as she guides us around the artifacts on display. Before we knew it , 2 hours are over already. I think best time to visit is on a Friday where museum hours are extended upto 9 pm.so you can still have a look see after the guided tour. When we were there the special exhibit was that  Fallen Pagoda on display, A must visit it before everything goes back to Xian, China . Check their website, I think this exhibit  runs upto June 2014"
tropicalnorth,433,May 2014,April 2014,30,diverse collection of SouthEast Asian material but poor explanations,"I went to this museum at the time of the Fallen Pagoda special exhibit. A Singapore Airlines boarding pass will give you a discount (approx $2) off the admission price to the permanent collection.  However buying a special exhibit and permanent pass together gives you a $4 discount. This is a fairly small building with 90% of the collection on the second floor. The permanent collection has information on the history of Singapore including the different districts. There's also material on furniture, lacquer, jewelry and the Quran.  There are also video displays which do take some time.  I ended up spending about 3hr there. While there was a lot of material and English tags, I found the English information merely descriptive (i.e. describing the physical thing) but not placing it in context.  I also found it a bit bewildering as they classified material by category (e.g. jewelry) and put Indian, Chinese and Malay jewelry all together.  It was not clearly demarcated and could be confusing.  The Fallen Pagoda ends May 4 so I will not review it.<br/>In the end, it was a nice place to spend a few hours if you have not experienced much in Southeast Asia but there are few ""must see"" items, more a collection from various countries collected in one place.  I wouldn't go back and the see the permanent collection again."
weeburn,113,May 2014,April 2014,50,An entrance to the civilisation of south-east Asia,"It was an amazing museum, exhibiting items representing various cultures in south-east Asian. Good place to get a first view on the region."
Ignacio A,91,Apr 2014,May 2013,50,Fantastic small museum,"This museum is a little jewel. In front of Fullerton hotel (other side of the river) , this small museum contains many valuable pieces and the tour and themes sequence are very well planned to get inmersed in the history of Singapore and Asia chronologically. One of my favourite museums worldwide."
eaker_face,95,Apr 2014,NA,50,Great collection,"Loved the museum, the exhibitions are fantastic and very well curated. The layout, lighting and artifacts all contribute to a very easy to enjoy museum which is informative. I took a free tour which was also very good. The guide was clearly very knowledgeable."
Jennifer B,107,Apr 2014,July 2013,50,I visit every time I am in Singapore,"This is one of the best museums I have been to in the world, especially when you are new to Asian culture. There is a wealth of information available, the guides are intelligent and friendly, and there are outstanding artifacts on display. Free English tours every afternoon - how can you beat all that?"
SMW977,33,Apr 2014,September 2013,50,Exactly how a museum should be,"The place is fantastic, the Asian Civilisations Museum should be an example to other museums.<br/><br/>Took the opportunity to visit the museum whilst we were in Singapore for the GP. When we turned up we were lucky enough to be told a tour would be starting in 10mins and decided to join the tour. The lady who conducted the tour was excellent, She was both balanced enthusiasm and knowledge to provide us with a most interesting and insightful guide a selection of the exhibits. She took the time to answer all our questions and really help us get so much more out of the museums excellent collection than we would have had if we and been on our own.<br/><br/>This museum has a fantastic collection and it has been carefully and thoughtfully presented. There is ample information available to help you understand the history and significance of each display."
Tony P,30,Apr 2014,March 2014,30,Great exhibit on Chinese relics,A lot of rooms which because it is an old building are somewhat randomly organised. There is a lot to see in the museum so we concentrated purely on the ancient Chinese relics and some associated exhibits nearby. Toilet facilities were hard to find. The cafe on the ground flor has excellent teas and very good views over the river.
Surjorimba,399,Apr 2014,April 2014,50,Must Visit,"Whenever you visit Singapore, I suggest you check Asian Civilizations Museum program schedule. They always have interesting programs. In 2012 I went to their China's Terracotta. And recently they have artifacts from China again. Everything is perfectly arranged, and very informative. The place is near City Hall MRT station.<br/><br/>Other than seasonal programs, they have their regular and permanent attractions covering Indian, Arabian, SEAsian culture and heritage. Even though you're not interested in their special programs, these permanent programs are still a-must see."
Guy A,55,Apr 2014,April 2014,40,Downtime - check this place out,if you want somewhere to go thats a bit out of the hustle and bustle then this place is the go to. Went and checked it out - amazing history in one place. Covers a lot of SE Asia &amp; India and worth the $8 or something to go. Spent about 1-1.5 hours there - quite a large place. Downside is no water can be taken in so for a thirsty westerner bit of a pain.
Richard289,"1,159",Apr 2014,April 2014,40,1300 artifacts might take a while!,"The Singapore Asian Civilizations Museum is located in the heart of downtown Singapore, near the mouth of the Singapore River, so the setting is a nice start.   The price of foreign adults was $8 plus $4 for a special exhibit.   The museum has 1300 artifacts on display, generally presented with very good lighting and with clear descriptions in English.  Exhibits focus on religious practices and traditions.   We spent about 2 hours but would need more time to do it justice.   We preferred this museum to the National Museum, which had NO captions on exhibits and relied fully on audio-tour recordings which malfunctioned."
qwerty182,70,Apr 2014,April 2014,50,very informative,The museum is not big but rather rich with exhibits. It is located close to Furleton hotel &amp; to find it was not so easy as it was construction protective items all over. Follow the signs with arrows or ask people. This museum is for those who is really keen on old  &amp; some historical  items showing the asian craft.
Nathan M,47,Apr 2014,September 2013,40,"Nice artefacts, what are they","This was a quick museum to visit whilst in Singapore, it is a fairly large expansive collection, the arrangment of the building itself was pretty complicated to understand. <br/><br/>Whilst there were many beautiful artefacts and some great large displays, the text captions were not very informative, there was also very few interactives and relied mainly on artefacts to tell the history."
HarryJohnston,25,Apr 2014,July 2013,50,Comprehensive - best done in a couple of visits,Outstanding museum to rival any others in its class world wide.<br/><br/>That said it is too much to take in on one go. Best just check out a few things for an hour or two then come back another day if you still have the desire to see more.
IanFromPort,75,Apr 2014,March 2014,50,Fascinating and informative,"Allow at least two or three hours to learn about the history of south east Asia, its culture, languages and politics"
firefox11,847,Apr 2014,December 2013,40,Great Place to Visit for a touch of History,Not a crowded place and most importantly - Free for Singapore Citizens and PR. Great place to bring the Kids!
Bkatzfamily,33,Apr 2014,March 2014,50,Wonderful,Great collection of artifacts from my different eras and cultures.  Dark inside so hard to get no flash pictures
Anna W,5,Apr 2014,March 2014,40,Interesting museum,"Great exhibits, laid out so not overwhelming.   Can do in about 2 to 3 hours.   We'll worth it.  Over 60 half price"
Tuttle51,112,Apr 2014,February 2014,30,Nothing Special,"This is a fairly small museum, though its collections are well-organized and decently labeled.  It has a variety of artifacts from China and SE Asia, but Japan and Korea are not represnted at all.  The traffic design is poor, requiring you to retrace your steps through what you've already seen in order to exit.  The brochure was a photocopied page.  The gift shop was a joke."
RfsowV,95,Apr 2014,March 2014,50,Allow plenty of time,"This is an excellent museum, with so many well constructed exhibits. If you like museums, you need to allow plenty of time to spend at this one, as there are so many parts to their exhibits, with incredible detail to all of the items. We went through all of the exhibits open at the time, and there was just so much to take in. We will certainly go back the next time we visit Singapore."
nugetz,155,Mar 2014,NA,50,Wonderful gem of a museum,A very well maintained museum with many interesting exhibits displayed and with informative writeups; many multimedia kiosks for one to view the videos and listen to the recordings and a few experiential corners too. Galleries have well defined themes and spaces are well planned to create good synergy with the exhibits. I don't usually visit museums but I find this one a real gem and worth every bit of time spent. In fact...I might just come again soon.
Celestefaisk,724,Mar 2014,March 2014,50,An extraordinary museum!,"It was our first time in an Asian country and visiting this museum made this experience even richer and more fascinating.<br/>First, we had a guided visit to a temporary exhibition of treasures belonging to the Famen Temple Museum, from China, about the period of Tang Dynasty. A special mention must be done to the gentleman who guided us, for his wide knowledge of the subject and the admirable way with which he conducted the visit (guiders perform as volunteers). After that, we explored other aspects of Asian Civilisations, visiting other rooms of the museum and its amazing collections of Indian, Malaysian, Chinese, Islamic Art, among others. Even the building is object of interest, for its architecture and history. There's a fee for entering the museum and a shop where one can buy lovely souvenirs and a great variety of Art books, including a very good catalog of the museum. I strongly recommend a visit!"
PeaceINdance,153,Mar 2014,January 2014,40,Wonderful and quaint museum.,I would consider ACM my fave museum in Singapore so far. I love the variety of exhibits and collections. It is a wonderful museum but it is lacking a little spice or another minor attraction -  to have a small cafe: to enjoy a sip of tea/coffee and dessert after perusing their collections.
MarcoSF,29,Mar 2014,March 2014,50,One of the best museums anywhere!,"We went on a Sunday morning and coincidentally arrived just in time for the English language tour. There were only 5 people on the tour so our docent could gear his presentation to our interests, in the context of his overall tour. The docent, Sanjay, was very knowledgeable and pleasant. The museum presents the various cultures of Asia, with info on history, religion, and a thorough selection of artifacts without overwhelming you with too much to look at. The lighting design is amazingly accurate so items are illuminated completely and separately so you really concentrate on one item at a time. <br/>I will definitely go back on my next visit to Singapore and spend more time to explore the extensive collection. Plus the air conditioning is a great relief from the outdoor weather!"
Marialena D,175,Mar 2014,March 2014,40,Small with a lot of variety.,"It didn't take ages to go around all the exhibits as it usually does, which is a really good aspect. It's a great introduction to Singapore, how it developed through time but also about surrounding civilisations. It included interesting exhibits about the export businesses, textiles, musical instruments, religious beliefs and culture.<br/>It doesn't take long, do give it a try."
ToniYuen,92,Mar 2014,February 2014,50,Kudos to the curators,"Have consistently enjoyed ACM for it's unique exhibitions and thoughtful presentations. Children's activities (also for the young-at-heart) are creative, fun yet educational. A great escape from the tropical heat. Highly recommended."
Kellen F,25,Mar 2014,September 2013,30,Nice Collection,"They had a solid collection across all of Asia, the Singapore history was interesting. I was hoping for more interactive exhibits and more stories. Felt closer to an art museum at times."
subversion,16,Mar 2014,NA,50,Amazing,"A must, you could spend days there..<br/>Pretty gold made, nice light. A lot oft interesting stuff from all over asia.<br/><br/>Only the way through was a bit confusing for me :)"
AMWN,544,Mar 2014,February 2014,50,Do the free guided tour,We visited on our last morning in Singapore and spent a very enjoyable few hours here.  We were lucky enough with the timing of our visit that a free tour was about to start.  This was a really interesting trip around Asia with our guide!  Well worth joining in.
sleepys,93,Mar 2014,March 2014,40,Worth a visit,"Good collection.  We lucked into a special exhibit of artifacts and artwork borrowed from Xian, China.  Very interesting.  Exhibit is till May 2014.  Definitely worth a visit."
Euggen,161,Mar 2014,April 2013,50,Very interesting place,"You get an overview of the different cultures that reside in Singapore. The house is beautiful, the exhibits are well set up: a must if you are interested in the history of SE Asia."
weisze,45,Mar 2014,March 2014,30,"So So, but place was very noisy","Exhibits were interesting and videos were good, but there were a lot of tourists and children milling around and talking very loudly."
Mandy B,49,Mar 2014,February 2014,50,Interesting Collection,"Good for a couple of hours of wandering. Nice collection of artworks and artifacts from the region, needs a cafe (rather than a restaurant) for a cuppa and piece of cake."
aieaairborne,72,Mar 2014,February 2014,50,One of the Best Museums,"The ACM is one place that I visit each trip to Singapore to see the current display. I have found it to be an amazing place - with its regular displays reflecting upon SE Asia to be of great interest and one of the best have seen anywhere. What I really enjoy going and seeing are the expositions that they rotate, with the current one being from the ruins of a pagoda in China that I visited two weeks ago. The best experince has been the Islamic Art display a couple years back that included so many aspects from Cnentral Asia and even Moorish Spain that made for a great afternoon spent looking at the exhibits."
Paul L,699,Mar 2014,November 2013,50,One of the best museums I've been to,"Very centrally located near Anderson Bridge this museum seemed a little unfinished in November 2013 but that didn't detract from the excellence of the displays. Covering a huge array of time and covering a massive swathe of Asia this collection, set out thoughtfully and very tastefully, is the sort of place history buffs will find themselves getting lost in and losing all track of time.<br/><br/>A delight. And certainly something different from the garden/zoo style attractions Singapore is usually so synonymous with."
mgoi,21,Mar 2014,NA,40,One of Singapore's best museums,"A very well presented, comprehensive collection of East Asian and West Asian (ie Middle East) art. The focus is on those civilizations and cultures most Singaporeans hail from, which leads to the absence of Korean and Japanese art. Otherwise this is a must-see, a great introduction to art and cultures in the region."
SophiaK,"1,100",Mar 2014,February 2014,50,Very compact&amp;informative,"The museum can be described as small and beautiful. Try to get one of the tours offered by the museum.  Our 1 hour tour emphasized on the differences and similarities of the muslim, hindu and budhism religions prevalent in the area and how these religions shaped the history and progress of Singapore. The ambiance of the museum is superb and although I've seen similar artifacts in other places around the globe the presentation along with the tour it makes a difference."
Paul N,380,Mar 2014,NA,50,Brilliant. But have plenty of time,We arrived at the museum with about an hr til they closed. They advised the tour takes about 1.5 hrs. So we said grand well rush through. Honestly is say it takes 2 hrs minimum. Saw the normal exhibit and the special one. Very briefly. Would loved to have spent more time.
Kerog,459,Mar 2014,February 2014,50,An excellent museum,"This museum is near Clarke Quay and is divided into a number of sections. I got here at opening time and was confronted by large numbers from tour buses. A tip would be to get there about an hour after opening as they we going then. There are guided tours around the museum and the guides seemed to quite knowledgeable. it is worth paying the extra if there is a special exhibition at the museum. The displays are well signed and you can move easily through the museum. The various sections are very interesting an you get a good idea of the culture and art work of Asia.  The entrance fee is very cheap. After your visit buy and ice cream from the vendor near the bridge for S$1, they are delicious. If you want an excellent luch go to Indo Chine next door and sit outside over looking the river."
jitub77,54,Feb 2014,September 2013,40,Great for history buffs,"Th museum is a majestic colonial era building, and is next to Clarke Quay, which is famous for its nightlife. The museum has a fairly good collection which is divided into sections, and offers an excellent insight into the history of the country and the region. A great place to visit if you are a history buff. <br/>There is a nominal entry fee and on certain public holidays (Chinese New Year etc), entry is free.<br/>You can spend a pleasant 3 hours at the place and then take a walk down clarke quay or do the river cruise as the sun sets; and thereafter settle down at the numerous restaurants and bars for a nice meal.<br/>A great way to spend a whole day."
andy_lewis_uk,131,Feb 2014,NA,40,Very good if you're already familiar with regional history,"We came at 2PM, which turned out to be an hour before the guided tour started. We didn't fancy waiting so went ahead and explored the place ourselves. The rooms are laid out per region (South Asia, South East Asia, China, Middle East). We'd spent the last 6 weeks travelling the region so it was good to get a recap of all that we'd seen elsewhere plus more. The exhibits and explanatory maps are very good. The only thing really missing was 'the big picture', since there is a lot of detail but not a grand overview - a time line or interactive map to connect the information in the different rooms, or a more chronological layout would have been good. I'm sure the guided tour would have filled us in on all that, but the timing didn't suit us and there are no audio guides. Still definitely worth a visit though."
Anand1351,"2,594",Feb 2014,March 2013,50,No Doubt best museum in Singapore,"One of the ""must visit"" place in Singapore. Undoubtedly best museum in Singapore, nominal entry fee. Lots of section with interesting stuff, easily can spendhours here and not get bored. Islamic section is quite interesting.<br/>Worth a visit."
edinburgher2,267,Feb 2014,February 2014,50,Well worth a visit.,"Excellent museum with wonderful displays, well lit and with very good information panels.  Entrance is inexpensive and there is so much to see that there should be something for everyone no matter how little time you have. <br/><br/>We particularly enjoyed the SE Asia Galleries and spent around 2 hours inside. The cool interior is a welcome respite from the heat and humidity outside."
Athena_Aurora,60,Feb 2014,February 2014,50,Clear your schedule; this is gorgeous,"Coming museums in South East Asia without such attention to detail, I unthinkingly expected to spend only a couple of hours here wading through poor English and incongruous exhibits. This was far from the case! <br/><br/>Three hours (and I could have spent longer) in a comfortable air conditioned, extremely well laid-out, wonderfully lit and fantastically comprehensive collection of artifacts, stories and multimedia. If you have time to kill in Singapore, kill it here!"
BPRT-8683,67,Feb 2014,February 2014,40,Lovely afternoon spent wandering the museum,"A nice overview of the history of Asia. Pristine building,with attention to detail - nice furnishings! Would not recommend the bar at night - the service was slow."
Eleni O,227,Feb 2014,February 2014,50,A Jewel of a Museum,"The complexity of all Southeast Asian cultures shines through the perfectly appointed and documented galleries of this hospitable museum. Special exhibitions frequently feature particular findings and geographies in a most accessible manner while the permanent historical background remains an inexhaustible area of interest. The museum is at the very attractive heart of Singapore, next to the old Parliament and across from the lovely Fullerton Hotel, right on the lazy waters of the Singapore River.<br/>Open House days are offered frequently and free admission to seniors on Monday afternoons."
Arthur W,648,Feb 2014,February 2014,50,Magical Museum,This place is awesome. The time and effort put in by the staff to explain the history of Singapore from way back in history until the present day is exemplary.
Manco T,204,Feb 2014,January 2014,50,A must-do museum stop in Singapore,You will learn a lot by visiting the Asia Civilizations Museum - a panoramic view not just of Singapore history but of the region.
Julie B,51,Feb 2014,February 2014,50,Learn about our Asian neighbours,"This Museum, as with all of them in Singapore is outstanding. The way things are presented is innovative and beautiful as well as so educational. My only negative is that some of the information plates in displays are not brightly lit enough and this made reading difficult at times. It's a must see Museum in a singapore."
James_Supertramp_Th,278,Feb 2014,February 2014,50,Best Museum,"My favorite in Singapore, it not crowded at all but still huge and interesting. You get a lot of awesome facts and see buddha statues and everything. Don't forget your camera and check the homepage for exhibitions and opening hours (on same days they have special prices during a specific time)."
Halkidis,"4,632",Jan 2014,January 2014,50,Great museum,"Perfect central location right by the river. Large place and lots to see. Some really nice exhibitions and definitely worth of visit. And then little ""warning"". Outside of the museum hangs fake monks. We saw them several times and they're trying to get donations to their monastery etc. from tourists. Many locals said that they are fake and if there was a police near, they sure went fast hiding"
netia1128,209,Jan 2014,January 2014,50,Diverse Accumulation of Knowledge,"A wealth of knowledge here about all of the cultures in Southeast Asia. Check out pictures, paintings, sculptures, and more."

HFLin,7,Jan 2014,January 2014,50,Great place for knowlege,The museum is a great place if you want to know the diverse cultures in Asia. I am lucky enough to  meet the guide in museum giving us great introduction about the history and culture in this region.
marie-nairn,74,Jan 2014,September 2013,50,Lacquer exhibition,Most interesting exhibition which I enjoyed very much and I hadn't realised all the work behind Lacquer which can be very valuable.
Vnyc80,137,Jan 2014,September 2013,50,Covers a lot of topics!,"I love museums, so take this with a grain of salt, but I thought this was a great museum. It was small, so more manageable, but they packed in a lot of different groups/tribes/time periods/categories! There were sculptures, weapons, textiles, furniture, jewelry, scientific instruments. I really appreciated the written descriptions of the different groups and timeperiods, they were more well done than usual. I spent about 3 hours in here and felt like I had gotten a good overview of almost the whole place."
Tanya D,20,Jan 2014,October 2013,40,This is the best museum in Sing,"This is the best museum in Singapore in my view.  Take your time to view the collection - at the end of your 2 hour visit you will be able to see the individual identities of, and symbionic relationships accross, different cultures in Asia."
mimi246,50,Jan 2014,January 2014,50,A Must,Because of it raining we did several Museums that day.<br/>This a must in how Singapore with the diversity of the city<br/>and it culture.
Fulltimevagabonds,274,Jan 2014,January 2014,50,Worth A Look,"A great Museum and a beautiful building, they also hold free lectures in the basement on Mondays and Fridays. They are conducted by The Friends of The Museums Group."
Winter102,49,Jan 2014,January 2014,50,Fascinating!,A really interesting museum. If there's a good exhibit you can easily look track of time. Nice way to spend the day and escape the heat of Singapore.
AlysBaxter-Holz,4,Jan 2014,January 2014,50,Great overview of Asian history,If you don't want to spend your entire trip to Singapore in museums them definitely hit up the Asian Civilisations Museum. It covers the whole of Asia and gives you a great sweep of history. So much to see and learn about Asia so this certainly simplified the adventure.
Huss-syd,11,Jan 2014,NA,50,Definitely worth a visit,Extremely impressed with the interactive displays and free tours. It's very comprehensive and shows a lot of history of many religions etc. a must go if you visit singapore!
Rand C,131,Jan 2014,December 2013,50,an impressive collection,"This museum was a real surprise.  I was unprepared for the size and quality of the collection as well as the excellent presentation and interpretation.  It does a magnificent job of including all the ethnic and religious groups that contribute to Singapore's stunning cultural diversity.  Plan on spending several hours here, with a break at the museum's café."
ArizonaTraveler2,147,Jan 2014,December 2013,50,Best museum,Our second visit here and very informative - we think the best of Singapore museums.  Location in the center and within walking distance from our hotel.
RichieThomas,46,Jan 2014,June 2013,50,"Beautifully presented history of Singapore, Malaysia and Asia in general","The beautiful building that houses the ACM is nestled in the heart of the wealthy business district, and is one of the finest collections of Asian history that I have seen.<br/><br/>Well presented, informative but also innovative (so you don't feel like you are in a claustrophobic, old-fashioined museum) you can easily spend a few hours here, and when you need refreshment there are a few cafes adjoinuing the building, for stunning views over the modern skyline."
slaia,14,Jan 2014,December 2013,40,A lot to see and to learn,"I enjoyed the visit and learned a lot, especially about the rice culture and the parts dedicated to Nias, Batak and Dayak. But the museum hosts more than that, but I couldn't see more as I only had half day time. So it's worth to spend one day in this museum and get to know more about the civilisation in South East Asia, South Asia and China."
Jason R,14,Jan 2014,January 2014,50,Fantastic Museum,"There is so much information in this museum that I couldn't see it all in one trip.  My brain just got too full.  A lot of galleries about various regions.  Informative videos all over the place.  Everything was labelled, though there were a few times when I wanted a little more specific details.<br/>Definitely recommend a visit."
Alertbutsafe,44,Jan 2014,January 2014,50,A good museum is like a knowledgeable friend ...,"I will always find things I am interested in here. I love to visit the Asian countries, recent years in south east Asia. one place I would always choose to go before my trip to a south east Asia country is Asian Civilisation Museum. Study the culture and then go. You'll never regret!<br/><br/>It is free for PR, $8 for adult, there are some free charges and discount rules on the website. HOpe it helps.<br/><br/>http://www.acm.org.sg/visitor_info/admission_charges.html"
DebraV369,36,Jan 2014,October 2013,40,Interesting.,Very interesting if you are into Asian history.  Makes you realise how far Singapore has developed &amp; how proud Singaporeans are of their heritage
igbotrevordc,61,Jan 2014,December 2013,50,"Fascinating, well-done exhibits","Very interesting, high quality exhibits, and the various video kiosks with recordings from individuals with personal ties to the subjects of exhibits were well done and insightful."
Lena G,276,Dec 2013,December 2013,40,Far reaching but focused exhibits,"a short walk from MBS the ACM is really worth a look. It covers a lot of ground from Turkey through to Philippines and on, but the exhibits are quite focused, few choice pieces rather than endless displays of pottery fragments! <br/><br/>There are a number of tours each day, mainly in english which give you deeper insight in to a few key areas. Worth it if you can manage. <br/><br/>We didnt go, but the cafe looked fabulous and I would be keen to visit another time. <br/><br/>Probably need to be quite involved if taking kids, there are interactive options but not necessarily aimed at little ones"
TreeKoala2013,49,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,Well run museum!,"Beautifully laid out, offers free tours at certain times by volunteer docents, and offers a great overview of the cultures, religions, and interplay of societies from the Middle East to South East Asia.  Great introduction if new, nice review if you've traveled and seen things.  Might be hard for young children, nothing interactive.  Lots of stairs, but there is an elevator (lift)."
Tommaso Q,56,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,Great Collection and guided tour,"I visited on Friday at 7pm to get the half-price ticket and I got also a free tour with a passionate guide (she is originally from Hungary). The collection is huge and it will definitely take more than two hours, so do invest more time there, but take the chance of a guided tour: despite the written explanations being very good only a guide knows all the secrets. <br/>There are South-East Asia, Chinese, Indian and Arabic sections. All great!"
flyingbreak,44,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,Fascinating insight into Asian region,"An excellent museum in Singapore, easily accessible and reasonably priced (SG$8, £4, US$6.5). You could easily spend hours in the museum looking the exhibits from around Asia, with different rooms for different regions. Fascinating artifacts, well presented and good quality information about a lot of the exhibits.<br/><br/>Would be on my list for attractions to visit in Singapore and learn about the history of the area. It's always useful to have a plan for when it rains (as it often does on a daily basis in Singapore!!)"
SDM6,13,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,Comprehensive,You could (should?) spend hours in here as the collections are so detailed it's almost overwhelming. Beautiful art collections.
RichardB32322,79,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,Great Tours,"Wonderful exhibits featuring how the diverse ethnicities that make up the Singapore population have many common attributes, as well as fascinating differences.  More than worth your time."
mayling c,34,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,Great for history fans,"I've been to all the museums in Singapore, and I have to say this one was my favorite. Definitely worth the visit. Countless amounts of artifacts and a great deal of information. Very well organized and easy to navigate. 5/5 stars."
Henry F,542,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,A superb museum,"My wife and I did not take the guided tour, but spent three hours on our own, and just loved the museum. It is very reasonably priced (8 Singapore dollars for adults - half price for seniors), with fabulous displays of costumes and artifacts from throughout the history of China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and other Asian cultures. Excellent English explanations accompany most displays, and the displays are logically and attractively arranged. We found this one of the best museum experiences we've had in a long time. A good Vietnamese restaurant on the premises adds to the positive experience."
Balisand,181,Dec 2013,October 2013,40,Rare and beautiful pieces,"The museum is in a good location, easy to reach, and is housed in an old government building. Which is a strength - we're walking through the history - and a weakness - the layout of the rooms is labyrinthine and can be hard to navigate. But this is countered by the superb pieces on display, and the excellent interpretive material. A visit is highly recommended."
Lynette9,39,Dec 2013,December 2013,30,A bit much walking,We took a guided tour and the guide was very pleasant but really went into much more detail than we were looking for.  We got quite tired after half an hour and bailed out.  We had lovely morning tea at the Tea Rooms attached by the river.  Very pleasant.
Suratrichard,956,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,Singapore should be proud of this attraction,"Visited this excellent museum on a wet Sunday afternoon and really enjoyed the experience. Situated a few minutes walk from Raffles' statue close to the river, it is certainly worth visiting whatever the weather. Admission is only SGD5 with a 50% reduction for those aged 60 or over and guided tours are available.The museum is open every day from 9am to 7pm (apparently on Monday it doesn't open until 1pm)  In the Singapore river gallery, you can see how Singapore developed around the river from the 14th century onwards. <br/>You can spend as long as you like looking at exhibits in the South East Asia galleries, the West Asia/Islamic galleries , the China gallery and South Asia galleries. Some of the exhibits are breathtaking. Although we didn't make use of them, there is, according to the leaflet a café and restaurant. There is also a small shop near the museum entrance. Non flash photography is allowed.<br/>Well worth visiting."
Jean-Pierre C,55,Dec 2013,November 2013,50,First class,"Like most everything else we have seen in Singapore, this is first class. We spend several hours enjoying the exhibits in this quiet oasis away from the heat and humidity."
chutti2010,24,Dec 2013,November 2013,50,The museum tells a story - go an listen to it,The museum houses exhibits from around the region and tells the story of Singapore and more. The role of the monsoons in making Singapore the trading hub it has become and the myriad of artefacts from around the region in a compact space make it a very interesting museum. ACM presents the entire region in a compact hi density and yet well chosen artefacts. A must see if you have a couple of hours or half a day to spend learning about the region and the civilisation.
BYKReddy,30,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,Good place to Know about Asian Civilisation,Worth watching all Asian countries civilisations on spending SGD 8$. Good place to let children know about asian civilisation.
AceGemGuevarra,238,Dec 2013,July 2013,40,Never thought it would be fun looking around!,"Not really into museums, but since it is included in the package I purchased, why not avail of it. <br/><br/>Very educational and cool museum. Never thought I would enjoy almost an hour just looking around. It's cool to see how Singapore used to be. I mean, Singapore is one of the richest countries in the world as we know it but how they were few decades back is very interesting to discover."
mojoan,20,Dec 2013,October 2013,50,A place filled with history,"The various cultures which contributed to Singapore's creation and growth are thoughtfully<br/>presented. The history of each, the interconnections, their art forms and traditions are displayed through artifacts and written explanations. We took advantage of a regularly scheduled tour which was excellent. Well worth a visit!!"
Degsy007,113,Dec 2013,November 2013,50,8 Singapore dollars-bargain!,"Huge, beautifully presented museum charting the fascinating continent of Asia. Really cheap entrance fee and it houses some gorgeous iy=tems, all explained in English. Make an effort to spend a couple of hours here."
UKtravelpen,38,Nov 2013,November 2013,50,An educational treasure,"I popped in during one of those sudden heavy showers that you get in Singapore and ended up spending a couple of hours there.  The displays are great, with interact ion interesting and fun.  It is amazing  to see what Singapore was and realise how much the Singaporeans have done.  If you are in Singapore this is a good place to spend an hour two between shopping and eating."
azeusa,27,Nov 2013,August 2013,50,One of my favourite museums in Singapore,"The permanent collection is housed in an atmospherically dim, intensely evocative setting with some interactive panels and vivid tableaus of artefacts placed in sympathetic, realistic and artistic arrangements. Hosts interesting roving exhibits from time to time. And the low entry price makes the Museum a cool, beautiful respite on hot days in the city/ colonial district."
Colourqueen,288,Nov 2013,November 2013,50,Not to be missed,"Loved this museum, well worth the visit. We walked here after the Buddha Tooth relic Temple. A good idea to combine both in a day. <br/>Lots of info about singapore's history."

tiger5687,101,Nov 2013,November 2013,40,Excellent collection,There is so much to see and we were so tired it was too much.  Great place to while away a few hours.  Could not believe the various items on display from all over south east asia.  Very interesting.  Another good place for middle of the day because of air conditioning.  Good location across the road from the The Fullerton.
glennaa11,334,Nov 2013,November 2013,50,Great Collection,This museum has a very extensive collection of Asian art and artifacts. I took the free English language tour which was very enlightening. The tour lasts about an hour and shows you the highlights of the collection.<br/><br/>My hotel had vouchers available that offered free admission to the museum.
Pablo M,27,Nov 2013,July 2013,50,Best museum,I think its a must to all travellers visiting Singapur. Have 2 hours to check it out at least so you can leave with a bit of history about Singapure and the rest of asia.
Sheila S,359,Nov 2013,October 2013,50,An excellent overview of the various cultures that make up Singapore,We only had time for a fairly brief visit so did a short guided tour which gave us a good overview of the various cultures. Very good guide. Would like to have had more time to also explore on our own. Some lovely exhibits.
Paul_n_Cris,"1,644",Nov 2013,November 2013,30,a little to sterile,"Read the reviews before going and decided that I had to visit this place, but I became a little disspointed. Ok so they have glass boxes with some very old bits in them, but in some places they were spread out as if you were in some high class art museum. I like the museums that  make you feel you are going back in time and the articfacts are built into show cases showing how they were used. Here they are in glass boxes, often on their own or with a couple of other bits. there was plenty of write up's on the bits but after a while you don't want to read another monolog of this vase, or that sword. On 3 floors, there is a lift that can take you up, but take the offered guide map as you can esily get lost as you wonder from one area to the next. There are some interactive screens where you can listed to different stories, but no audio gulde that some people like. Cost $8 adult"
surfie999,101,Nov 2013,December 2012,40,Cool quiet and informative,"a cool oasis on a hot day in downtown Singapore.  Often has special exhibitions so need to check those out in a current brochure.  Regular exhibitions give a good overview of historical context of much of Asia, especially SE Asia.  For Australians, a good introduction to the history of the region - since most do not ever study the area"
Blueberries3,9,Nov 2013,November 2013,50,Very informative,We were lucky to join a free guided tour of this very interesting museum. I'd recommend it to others visiting Singapore.
glassyraven,364,Nov 2013,November 2013,50,Excellent view of the diverse cultures of Asia,"We were very impressed by the informative placards and objects in their collection and learned a lot.  And we arrived just before the rain -- and went to lunch after the rain had stopped -- and returned in the afternoon to pick up where we left off.  Just don't lose the little sticker you put on your shirt.  Very much worth the time and money.  We took the bus there from our hotel near Orchard &amp; Scotts.  You need the correct change, but you can buy your ticket from the bus driver -- the price is based on how long your trip is.  We paid 1.10 S$ each, one way.  Google maps tells you which bus to take and where to get off -- and where to get back on.  There are signs at the bus stops that give the stop # and which buses stop there.  For our hotel they involved less walking than the MRT."
EatAlready,5,Nov 2013,November 2013,50,Glimps of Asian History,"We got to learn the Asian history in 3 hours. Quite educational and well rounded. Covers the Chinese, Indian, ASEAN and Singapore history in brief. Worth the time spend."
JAST20,108,Nov 2013,October 2013,50,Fascinating place,Tremendous amount of information and very well displayed.  We happened to go in just as a free one hour guided tour was about to start and so joined it. It was well worth it as the guide was very knowledgeable and this gave us a good introduction for another 3 hours of looking around.
Lora F,30,Oct 2013,NA,50,Must see,"Have lunch at boat quay and head over when it's super hot out or raining to the museum. If you want Singapore history go to the national museum. This is more south east Asia. Amazing Buddhas, Hindu, Indian, Chinese cultures. Really nice, educational museum."
Little_World2012,130,Oct 2013,October 2013,50,A must see in Singapore,"The best school ever to learn about Asian cultures, religions and diversity. Please go! Very extensive and rich collection. Be prepared to stay there for 3 hours at least. Well presented and organized collection. The cafe is awful by the way (with beautiful river view, though). <br/>I believe the museum could offer us some chairs along the way though..."
Kate M,153,Oct 2013,October 2013,40,Excellent,I have visited the Asian Museum many times and I have never been disappointed.  Staff are friendly and changing exhibitions are always interesting. <br/><br/>Good value for money in what is becoming a very expensive city. Highly recommended.
Stourton1582,215,Oct 2013,September 2013,50,So much to see,"We spent hours in here and still didn't see everything that was available. We particularly liked the special exhibition on Buddhist art, and also the exhibition about the Singapore River. But there is so much to see, everyone will find something interesting."
Just-Julie-Cairns,896,Oct 2013,October 2013,50,Extremely Interesting,We love visiting museums and while in Singapore decided on the Asian Civilisations Museum. We spent a good two and a half hours here looking at everything.  I was surprised you were allowed to take photos but pleased I could. The different rooms told different stories and we took our time taking in everything we could.  Well worth the small cost of entry especially if you are into history.
georgebraine,73,Oct 2013,October 2013,40,A quiet stroll in hectic Singapore,"I have been traveling to Singapore for 18 years, and, to my disappointment, Singapore has been becoming crowded, chaotic and one large construction site, more like Hong Kong where I live. So I was pleased to find this Museum, an oasis of hushed calm housed in a large, old, colonial-style building.<br/><br/>We were fortunate to catch the splendid Devotion &amp; Desire special exhibition which runs till early December. The exhibits were laid out in a manner which made the viewing easy. <br/><br/>We spent a relaxing two hours, and then went down to the cafe by the river, where we lingered happily over lunch. The service was very good."
DianeBrook,38,Oct 2013,September 2013,40,A surprising  wealth of exhibits,"We went because it was raining and we needed an indoor activity, we were very impressed by the museum. The guided tour was worth doing, although attempts to make our tour group contribute to the discussion were painful, please, tour guides,  just share your knowledge with us!"
svsmall,42,Oct 2013,September 2013,50,Great Museum,"We love this museum.  It's a great intro to Asia - since Singapore is a crossroads for Asia.  The displays are informative, well laid out.  The docents are well trained and very helpful.  <br/><br/>don't miss this museum if you are in Singapore."
Jane M,28,Oct 2013,September 2013,50,Splendid,"Small, but so very interesting.  Full of beautiful and fascinating things, well laid out.  In addition, it is sited right by the river in a lovely cool spot of greenery."
bumbletraveller,277,Oct 2013,August 2013,50,Interesting and engaging,We enjoyed this museum more so than the National Museum - feeling that the actual artefacts on display were more interesting with good information.  We looked around I would say for an hour to hour and a half - stopping at the items we found most interesting.  Definitely worth a visit.
Sue K,911,Oct 2013,June 2013,50,Wonderful museum,Very close to boat quay is this wonderful museum. It tells you all about the different parts of Asia with animated guides to greet you at every level. I went on the free english tour. It is very useful as they show you where the best bits are and then you can wander round on your own. I loved it as I have been lucky enough to see lots of south East Asia .
Viphil M,41,Oct 2013,August 2013,40,A must for understanding Singapore history and culture,"A visit here complements one to the Peranakan Museum.  The museum is well laid out, without cluttering and plenty of space so it does not get crowded.  There's a (child-friendly) restaurant overlooking the river."
PoliPerth,303,Oct 2013,October 2013,50,Beautiful inside and out,"Located in an old building which has been beautifully restored, this is a lovely museum in which to spend a good 1/2 day.  Located right by the river just across from Boat Quay, easy to get to, only a 5 minute walk from Raffles Place MRT across the bridge.  Major building works on the main road at the front, though, so hard for taxis to drop you right at the door."
C C,5,Oct 2013,July 2013,40,Worth a couple of hours.,Small but well curated collection. Gives a quick overview of South East Asian and especially Malay / Singaporean history. Easily worth a couple of hours of your time.
PerBaadnes,268,Oct 2013,September 2013,30,Good but confusing,"The museum is a bewildering labyrint. Several nice and interesting things to see, but to find the way around and out again, is a nice task"
Jeeyem,183,Oct 2013,August 2013,50,Nice place to learn about cultural changes in Asia,"This place has history of Asian cultures evolution over time, good for kids to learn without travelling to many places"
Anita P,43,Oct 2013,September 2013,50,Take your time,"It is a great place to visit. Just take your time, don't rush through. Laser show in front of Marina Bay Sun is fantastic."
Rita O,7,Oct 2013,September 2013,50,Amazing,Did a tour with a volunteer - needed to spend a week to see everything. It was a true blend of cultures and religious beliefs. I loved it.
TOUFIQUR,249,Sep 2013,January 2013,30,great asian museum,"an institution which forms a part of the three museums of the National Museum in Singapore. It is one of the pioneering museums in the region to specialise in pan-Asian cultures and civilisations. The museum specialises in the material history of China, Southeast Asia, South Asia and West Asia, from which the diverse ethnic groups of Singapore trace their ancestry.<br/>Contents."
well_fine,198,Sep 2013,September 2013,50,1/2 day is not enough,"It was last day of our visit in Singapore and we thought to visit this museum after reading TA. There is a fee to visit the museum but I think money well spend. They had some free tours during lunch time and we went to them all. The tours were very informative and made me enjoy the experience of the museum even more. Air con was a plus as Singapore was so hot. A lot of artifacts were on displayed so one could easily spend a day in this museum. If you have time and not sure what to do, visit this place."
hercoolgr,50,Sep 2013,September 2013,50,The best museum in town,"Probably the best Asia Civilizations Museum on earth. Comprehensive, easy to navigate and...play! Especially the part for SE Asian Civilizations is extensive. Worth a visit, especially during a rain pore"
travelm858,153,Sep 2013,September 2013,40,Love it,"Been twice, some beautiful artifacts and a good history of Singapore for $8 it's air conditioned and a good couple of hours of entertainment. When you've finished cross the bridge to the <br/>Fullerton for a beverage."
RoInCo,152,Sep 2013,September 2013,50,Interesting Museum in a Beautiful Venue,"This museum was truly interesting and had a fascinating collection and exhibits.  It was worth visiting for a couple of hours.  On Friday nights at 7 p.m., admission is half price and we were fortunate to arrive in time for a free guided tour of the latest exhibition.  It was a great way to learn more about the culture and religions of the region.  It certainly is a good rainy day activity.<br/><br/>The building itself is beautiful and it is centrally located in Singapore, so it is very nice to walk around and see other sights in the area as well."
Stanleyalb,121,Sep 2013,September 2013,50,Fascinating,"We have been to Singapore a couple of times, but haven't managed to fit in this museum, . . . until now.  It is really worth the visit - great exhibits, interactive displays, good for kids.  We spent a couple of hours here, which really wasn't enough.  We will come back again.  I only wish - along with many other museums in the world - that the gift shop would reproduce some of the tiems on display - such as materials (fabrics), jewellery, etc. rather than selling . . . . mass -produced items.  <br/><br/>A good experience and one which we would repeat."
GPenaflorida,"1,105",Sep 2013,September 2013,40,A couple of hours well spent!,"I'd been here once before in 2007 &amp; thought it's time for another visit. The museum housed in a beautiful old colonial building in a very nice part of the city by the river (if you stay till thy close as I did, you can just pop over to the riverside and watch the sun set over the city - very pretty!).<br/><br/>I paid an entrance fee of S$8 &amp; was told that non-flash photography is allowed. There's lots to see, read, learn, marvel at here. The only thing about this place that I didn't favour was the extreme ""mood"" lighting - in my opinion there were areas that were just a little too dark. Apart from this, all else was great.<br/><br/>With photography permitted, you can easily spend 2-3 hours (or possibly slightly more) here. My only regret is that I got here just a little too late (at around 4+pm), the museum closes at 7pm &amp; I had to skip a couple of areas. Despite having 2+hours, if you enjoy museums &amp; like taking photos, you may want to allocate a little more time."

CarolWestSussex,348,Sep 2013,September 2013,50,Great Museum,"This is a wonderful museum. We paid $2 each for a tour at 7pm on a Friday evening when the museum was really quiet. It was half price after 7pm and half price for senior citizens. Our guide, Myram, was extremely knowledgable and enthusiastic and outlined the highlights of each exhibition room, making connections between artifacts. Well worth a visit"

Alertbutsafe,44,Sep 2013,May 2013,50,One of the Top Museums in Singapore,"ACM has huge collections from all over the Asian countries, and its strength is the cross-cultural exhibition. Singapore is a small country but it is also big enough to tell stories of 4 major religions in the world and races of people from different continents of the world.

Go early on a weekday morning, basically had the museum to myself this morning.<br/><br/>The information, displays and interactive screens give an amazing view of how the Indian Ocean countries and China interacted over the centuries through trade, religion and exploration. <br/><br/>The artefacts from India, Sri Lanka and China stood out the most. The artisans skills are shown extensively, the lacquered items from China were very interesting.<br/><br/>This should not be missed - take your time to enjoy."

What an incredible place from the Ming statues that greet you in the portico of the building to the costumes and jewelry of hill tribes.This museum covers many aspects of Asian culture showcasing different countries, its not just about Singapore. As you move from one gallery to another, the displays show another layer of Asian culture. Along the way you notice what is similar between cultures and how certain places have held their own belief, rituals and practices. I found it interesting to look at and read the information on Chinatown and how the opium dens were run, see the sections dedicated to different religious statuary, tomb furnishings, calligraphy, clothing and art. When I visited there was a special exhibit on stupas.<br/>I spent 2 hours there but I could have easily spent longer.

Looks really complete, very educational and interactive. <br/>It's a large museum, yet we liked to enter each door that led us to different collections from different countries.<br/>Being in love with history since I was a teenager and love to know different cultures, this museum fed my curiosity.<br/>Overall... so much FUN with the kids there!!"
IbiM,141,Aug 2013,July 2013,50,Really interesting to know more about Southeast Asia,"It is a great place to understand Southeast Asia and Singapore, you get to see the differences as well as the common points of view."
Bernee2013,136,Aug 2013,July 2013,50,Excellent Museum!,We really enjoyed this Museum. It had lots of interesting artefacts and artworks from all around Asia. It was also very good to help you understand more of Singapore's past. Loved the fantastic old colonial building and the location beside the river too.
scott k,124,Aug 2013,July 2013,50,Quite educational,"For a relatively small museum it packs in a lot. This was a great surprise to me, as I learnt a lot about Asia and Singapore. Great exhibits along the way."
Phillyjanie,221,Aug 2013,July 2013,50,Beautiful and atmospheric,A stunning collection ....visit it with a river cruise and lunch nearby to round out a perfect afternoon.
Kressley G,60,Aug 2013,August 2013,50,Well worth a visit,"Entry fee is $8. <br/><br/>The Asian Civilisations Museum took me a good 2-3 hours to wander through. Comprehensive display of Asian from the Middle East, India, China, SE Asia, Indonesia and of course Singapore. <br/><br/>Excellent layout with some interactive displays."
Sidmar H,29,Aug 2013,July 2013,40,Asian Civ. Mus. is very diverse,This museum is large and diverse in its portrayal of many different kinds of Asian groups.  I liked the gold jewelry that was displayed as part of wedding wear and I liked the textiles.  There are teleprompters around that you can touch and actual people have taped informational messages for you.
Keith G,42,Jul 2013,October 2012,40,Asians civilization Museum,It was very interesting indeed and well worth a visit. It is well laid out and has good signage and display information.
maminixabi,24,Jul 2013,July 2013,50,Interesting exhibit,"The way the information was presented was interesting, interactive and very informative, there was a mix of multimedia and traditional museum display, I liked it better than the Aquarium actually."
runsinthefamily,156,Jul 2013,June 2013,50,A great guide giving a great intro to Asia,"If you want to understand how Asian countries, religions and people developed over centuries and perhaps if your visit to Singapore is your first Asian stop-over then this museum is a must. We took the mid-morning tour with a Franco-Japanese guide who was positively brilliant and very patient. She extended the allotted time and answered all the questions - and asked several that were answered by her daughter! She took us through the museum giving a potted version of each section and we were then free to go back to those areas that had attracted and interested us most. We went back to the Hindu, Chinese and Japanese sections but only time and tiredness prevented us doing more."
Jenny E,925,Jul 2013,July 2013,50,Free guided tour fantastic.,A fascinating museum in a stunning building.It was very wet so was a great place to spend some time.The guided tour explained so much and really engaged our 12 yo twins.We had a lovely lunch at the attached restaurant .We were the mad tourists outside under an umbrella during heavy rain!
pragzz,30,Jul 2013,July 2013,50,One of my favorite museums in Asia,"I absolutely love this museum. Its beautifully curated (by Asian standards of course), has great rotating exhibitions, has a great location, and ambience and is a real steal of a price. Definitely join the tours, if you can. Many of the docents spend years training and are very enthusiastic about their tours, though I can't say that they are always accurate (I know that for the Hindu and Buddhist sections, one of the docents did make some rather ridiculous explanations during the tour!). I love that its open late on Fridays and you pay half price if you go in after 5pm. The museum focuses on history, culture, religion, and ancient art around those themes. Very quiet and relaxing..."
Paul Drinkwater,127,Jul 2013,July 2013,40,Very interesting museum that i have visited multiple times,This is a very informative museum about the history and cultures of Asia. I have visited it multiple times and always find something of interest to keep me occupied for an hour or two. Its central location and good air conditioning are a bonus too.
Remi_Sg,41,Jul 2013,July 2013,40,Very interesting museum which covers most of Asian civilizations,"We spent a very interesting time in the Asian Civilizations Museum in Singapore.  Rare objects can be seen from China, South-East Asia, India as well as Muslim countries, and they are presented in a very good scenography.  Good comments, maps and timelines help you to understand these masterpieces and the related context.  If you like Art and Culture - don't miss this museum."
Travelap,41,Jul 2013,April 2013,40,Just beautiful,"A beautiful museum with exhibitions from all over Asia - cool and relaxing on a hot, steamy Singapore day."
Kay5000,29,Jul 2013,July 2013,50,Interesting,"It's well worth visiting to read and see Singapore's heritage and culture. It is close to Marina Bay, Singapore River and many restaurants so you can make a day of it."
Peter F,127,Jul 2013,July 2013,40,Beautifully staged exhibitions in a glorious building,"The building itself its a gorgeous colonial style, the scale of its exhibits perfect (not so big that you feel overwhelmed and not so small that you feel cheated) and the actual staging wonderful; the lighting and ambience and presentation of its collections are very well thought out and executed.  I spent 90 minutes there and considered it time well spent.  In July 2013 the only thing missing was a well-stocked Museum shop as I was hoping to pick up some gifts related to the exhibits. Almost next door to the Fullerton Hotel, in a gentle walkway and grass setting by the river."
Rajiv C,281,Jul 2013,September 2012,50,Really Good Place To Visit,"I have been to the Asian Civilisations Museum several times, solo, with my wife and with my kids.<br/>This is an excellent museum, with the exhibits well laid out. It is almost like going through a story at times. <br/>The place is suitably serious, and is meant for a person with a genuine interest in the civilisations of Asia<br/>This is a good place to visit"
Limecurry,91,Jul 2013,May 2013,50,"Small, but very well done","This is a quite small museum, but it provides an excellent overview of the different cultures of Asia and it it very well designed."
Duncantrips,46,Jul 2013,July 2013,40,"Good exhibitions, great tour guide","This is an interesting museum that has been quite well designed and has a lot of original artefacts. Two major issues however: one is that the lighting is very dim which makes it hard in places to see things clearly, and two is that the only toilet in the whole museum is in the basement, while most of the attractions are on the upper floor. <br/>The tour guides are volunteers who do a great job of explaining and answering questions. Visitors can learn a lot about Singapore's history from this museum, and also about the history of peoples in surrounding regions."
raliza,8,Jul 2013,January 2013,50,Excellent! Don't miss the guided tour,"Covers all and every culture of Asia from Japan to Turkey, Unfortunately I did not have as much time as I wanted to spend there. The museum itself is extremely well organised with a lot of ways to present information. Very amusing were the short videos presenting various members of the multiethnic society of Singapore.<br/>They have free guided tours made by volunteers, I think they are twice a day in English. It is an excellent opportunity to see the highlights and to learn much in short time. <br/>I would go back there again."
Dustin W,9,Jul 2013,NA,50,Amazing,Wonderful museum to explore Asian civilizations. Reasonably priced and well manicured exhibits. Was definitely worth the time and money.
Ngaire B,159,Jul 2013,July 2013,50,Worth a look,"This museum is worth a look at, as it gives you more than just a history of Singapore. There are exhibits from other parts of Asia."
JohnClay1,32,Jul 2013,July 2013,50,Might have missed this,We went here to fill up time and were very glad we did.  It was a super place with amazing artifacts.  I learned that laquer wear work began 6000 years ago.
TashySchu,62,Jul 2013,July 2013,50,The best museum I have been too,"If you love history,and like to see it in amazing exhibitions  do go to this museum. I was very impressed and it answered not only all the questions I had about Singapore but opened my eyes to the Asian civilisation. Beautiful exhibits displayed so well. you will be very impressed and culturally satisfied."
Andrew C,568,Jul 2013,October 2012,40,Excellent Museum,Set only a little way from Merlion is this excellent museum. The exhibitions are all very accessible and laid in a very good way. There was information on both ancient and more recent history and very diverse from across all of Asia. <br/><br/>I was very impressed and managed to wander around the museum for a number of hours - it was also a very welcome respite from the heat and humidity outside!
David H,89,Jul 2013,June 2013,50,"Wonderfully set out, some real treasures","If you want one culture stop to find out more about this part of the world, this is the place to visit. The exhibits are well set out, there are some objects here of incredible beauty. You learn a lot in a really enjoyable way. There are lifts/elevators to save your feet from stair climbs. Staff are friendly and helpful. Clean restrooms."
Peter A,79,Jul 2013,June 2013,40,The exhibits are splendid,"The exhibits are splendid, and comprehensive in scope. There are many interactive displays, and at the time of my visit there were guides/volunteers at some sections."
ClaytonSing,94,Jun 2013,April 2013,50,Asian REVEALED,"This is a MUST for me! <br/><br/>Take the free guided tour, it put these treasures in a context and connection to the cultures that makes it a joyous experience. You feel that you are walking through cultures and histories and seeing the sophistication and beauty through their eyes. A MUST"
ElainePerth,21,Jun 2013,May 2013,40,Museum,We ran out of time but could have spent a lot more time here so much to see and a good learning afternoon
OzzieBrunei,37,Jun 2013,June 2013,40,Interesting artifacts from various Asian cultures,"The exhibits were well-presented with informative information given about the artifacts. I particularly liked the world religions sections, that provided useful and interesting information about the various beliefs that have shaped the region"
GDMAUS,135,Jun 2013,June 2013,50,A must see,Excellent collection - well presented and very representative. One small complaint - signage and the descriptions of some artefacts were difficult to follow.
wea74,19,Jun 2013,June 2013,50,superb,This is an almost overwhelming museum with riches from all over SE Asia.  One of three places I thought it was really worthwhile to go (the others being the Orchid Garden and the Chinese Heritage Cultural Center).
ohiowanderer,"1,096",Jun 2013,June 2013,50,Interesting,I primarily went to escape the terrible air quality that Singapore has experienced recently.  But the museum was a delight.  It is in a lovely building on the river and is well laid out.  I had the place to myself.  It is a good introduction to Asia if you don't know much about the area.
Jasonreberger89,6,Jun 2013,NA,50,History,If you're into history then check this place out. Extremely informative and I spent quite a few hours there reading and looking through all the old relics. Really enjoyed.
LadyLou_12,24,Jun 2013,June 2013,50,Really interesting mix of artifacts,"-great tour guide called Joanna - very informative, and learnt a lot about items that I'd walked past earlier<br/>-cost: June 2013 $8 (about £5ish) but free if you're a Singapore citizen. Discounts for senior citizens and children/students. Cheaper for all on Friday afternoon - about half price<br/>-I only went in for something to do and a bit of air conditioning but really glad I did. The museum's aim is to show how each culture living in Singapore influences each other, in particular Chinese, Indian and a little British."
CowSense,979,Jun 2013,May 2013,50,The Asian Civilisation Museum at 1 Empress Place,The Asian Civilisation Museum at 1 Empress Place is worth a visit.   Here you can see the history and development of Indian art and religion.  The museum shows  you the spread of  Indian culture  and religion to China and Southeast Asia.  Buddhist sculpture has spread to Indonesia and China. On TV screen you can hear the commentators explain the history of Indian art and spread of Indian culture.
AKR1,384,Jun 2013,June 2013,50,Beautiful museum,"World class, superb lighting and display, very welcoming and photography allowed. If you are into South Asian and Chinese art a must see."
able58,"15,717",Jun 2013,June 2013,50,Incredible Exhibits,Singapore should be very proud of this museum...  absolutely world class displays.... probably the most interesting thing we saw in Singapore.  I would agree with a lot of posters here that some of the information can be difficult to read due to poor lighting and possibly a suggested itinerary would help.  Allow at least two hours to see the basics... three at best.
Hai Trieu P,17,Jun 2013,NA,50,Good museum ,Take your time to visit it. Totally worth it. Good staff and huge collection . You can find out a bunch of information by yourself easily
Isabel089,114,Jun 2013,May 2013,50,Extraordinary collection,"This museum merits several hours with its extensive and beautiful displays about a range of Asian cultures.  My only criticism is that many of the explanatory signs are placed quite low and in dim light - fine for shorter people with excellent vision, a little more challenging for others of us."
Anonymous A,3,Jun 2013,November 2012,50,Asian Civilisation Museum,"Really Cool! Fun Place To Be on a weekend, cool place for excursions and for tourists its really cool a great museum for Singapore!<br/><br/>Anonymous A. . . :D"
TripTalkHawaii,567,Jun 2013,May 2013,50,Fantastic collections,"Extraordinary collections are beautifully displayed at this lovely museum. Restaurant on site overlooks the river and the Boat Quay. Easy access from MRT, just a short walk over the bridge. Gift shop is very small. Plan to spend 2-4 hours here. There  is lots to see on many levels."
LionAngel,153,Jun 2013,May 2013,30,Interesting but could be better.,"The website had interesting stuff for kids to check out. The information for the exhibits were in book form and wasn't placed under any light so it was difficult to read as the lighting was dim at some of the exhibits.If the museum was crowded, it would have been tough to share reading of the information book.<br/>DId have some tours. But the girl at the ticket counter didn't inform us of this. Only learned about it when an announcement was made over the PA system. By then, kids and I were somewhere in the middle of the museum and not sure how to get back to the entrance."
Delan_Silva,69,Jun 2013,June 2013,50,A must for every visitor,"We made our day to the museum around noon after wandering around the city all morning. We accidentally entered through the rear of the museum but eventually made our way to the front.<br/><br/>Staff are (like most Singaporean's) very friendly, polite and helpful and the exhibits are very well presented and are representative of Asian history and not just localised.<br/><br/>The only downside was that I'd been awake more than 24 hours after a long and bumpy flight, coupled with the intense heat of the morning which left me struggling to keep up with the scale of the museum (seems quite compact, but is actually large and quite dense).<br/><br/>I will make this a definite stop on my next visit and the next time I'll be better prepared to truly appreciate a very well done museum."
mummygoplaces,156,Jun 2013,June 2013,40,Interesting and engaging,"Hubbs and I brought our kids (4 years old and 9+ years old) to the Asian Civilisation Museum over the weekend and we spent a good 2-3 hours there in the different Asian sections. It was generally interesting for the kids even though there had been a skull which freaked them out a bit, and the section with the huge Chinese deities was just a wee bit scary for my little girl (the 4 years old). There were touch screens where one could learn more about various customary practices which I found educational for both kids and adults, and the kids enjoyed the art area where they could assemble and decorate crowns and jewelry for themselves using the materials provided. They found that fun =) Of course, the ice cream vendor located just practically outside the museum helped lift their spirits (they each had one before entering the museum). There is a little museum shop selling storybooks on SEA culture and traditions, stationery and ornaments. There is an elevator for parents bringing kids on strollers and visitors who are wheelchair bound.  Have a fun day!"
AkM980,54,May 2013,April 2013,50,Relics and history,Like most museums there is masses to see and too much to see in one trip.<br/>The museum staff also give presentations to the public so we learnt about Buddhist temples and the symbolism of their design
Chatterboxmegan,701,May 2013,May 2013,30,Standard overwhelming museum,"This museum is designed for individuals with a previous knowledge of Asia and its religions. We found ourselves very confused most of the time. As we did not understand the explanations with the exhibits we could not appreciate the significance of alot of the items. Though exhibits are displayed very well and there is alot of information given for each one, we were lost by all various religious names, territories and types of civilian referred too. Im sure this museum would appeal to those from Asia, but not from me (from Europe) who do not have an understanding of Asian history."
The86Robsons,167,May 2013,February 2013,40,Interesting insight into local history,"Interesting insight into local history worth a look, interesting displays and statues.  Used for functions and connected to a good restaurant."
judymit,20,May 2013,May 2013,50,one of the best museums in the world,"range of works is staggering, curation and information excellent, media orientation one of the best parts, exhibition not too crowded, all the pieces of interest and quality"
JandJ68,165,May 2013,May 2013,40,History,"This museum is fascinating.  Its filled with artifacts and jewellery from all over Asia.  As an expat who does a lot of travelling I found myself looking at the display cases and seeing the orginals of items that I had bought in local markets in Laos, India, Thailand etc and reading about the history.  This is a great half day excursion.  And the ice cream man with his trolley is 20c cheaper outside the museum than his counterpart on the other side of the river, directly opposite.!!"
Angelus55555,51,May 2013,May 2013,30,Make sure you have a guide,"This is a really interesting experience, its centrally located so very accessible but not what i expected and you need to do 2 tours, once with a guide to explain as much abt asian history, geography and religon as anything else and a second time to see the exhibits."
TripFactory,51,May 2013,November 2012,50,A beautiful collection,"This is a place you simply cannot miss if you're into culture. Even if you're not, you should put this museum on your list of things to see."
GowriNK,141,May 2013,May 2013,40,"Beautiful setting, excellent collection!","This museum is huge and has a great collection of artifacts from various regions in South Asia. The way the exhibits have been laid out is excellent - the lighting, the information panels, the tours... <br/>This place deserves at least 3 hours of your time. :)"
tigersfire,1,May 2013,May 2013,50,"ancient civillization museum, Singapore","The staff has friendly service and there was free guided tour to know more about this place. The design of the exhibits was also very nice and the layout of the galleries was clear and well guided, visitors do not have to worry about getting lost in there. There was 2 galleries on the 3rd floor which allows visitors to have a hands on experience. So, overall experience was GREAT!"
alalas,671,May 2013,May 2013,40,"Well organized, worth a visit","WE found this one of the best museums we've been in Asia. It';s very well organized, with lots of information from almost all folks and cultures in Asia. The exhibition presents everything in an intelligent way and it didn't take forever to see the museum and also there's a lot of art pieces and not a lot of reading. Very enjoyable and a nice building in a great neighborhood. We recommend."
roddamranganath,562,May 2013,September 2012,40,"Huge, impressive and interesting!",This museum along with the display of regular artifacts sometimes hosts temporary galleries of very unique and valuable items that are rarely shown to public. I happened to visit when precious ceramic items of Ming dynasty was displayed and it was worth the visit. The history of various Asian civilizations is well displayed. Must visit for all history buffs.
Mary C,182,May 2013,April 2013,50,allow time for this,"We only had a couple hours to see the exhibits, and that's not really doing it justice. There is lots to see, with informative notices throughout. The staff very helpful. I would say you need a good half day or day to really appreciate the museum."
TasTravelBugs,26,May 2013,May 2013,50,Fascinating half day,"The building itself is very beautiful, inside the rooms are set out into Various rooms depicting different cultural groups, it is informative,very well set out and information in English.  Restaurant on verandah is fantastic."
Richard D,127,May 2013,August 2012,40,Nicely done,Singaporeans seem to feel the need to do all things as best they can and that trait is very much in evidence in this museum.  Don't go there at the end of the day or you'll be disappointed if they announce closing time and you've not seen it all. Give yourself plenty of time to enjoy this place. Singaporeans are rightfully proud of their heritage.
siroseleceng,9,May 2013,December 2012,40,A local bit of History,"From the earliest days, the museum shows the background to the modern city of Singapore, worthwhile seeing"
Pooja C,246,May 2013,April 2013,50,"Definitely a first date place, if you know your history",Brilliant place to check out. talks a lot about all Asian civilizations.<br/>It explores all the Asian cultures and specifically of Singapore. They have 5 galleries. all talking about different things. they also have video panels placed from place to place to explain more. Its a must go place if you are a history buff.
YubaPrincess,656,May 2013,May 2013,50,This is a must when visiting Singapore!,"Good collection of artefacts that reflect the cultural influences into Singapore, probably the best in SEAsia.  Artefacts are conserved beautifully.  Plenty of free guided tours that are informative! Located across the Singapore River from Boat Quay which teems with restaurants!"
Maat00,32,May 2013,May 2013,40,Babylon,"The museum raises to its name. I found some pieces of history there that also got my Asian friend excited to read about his ancestors, bringing him close to his roots."
Robtane,882,May 2013,April 2013,50,Wow for anyone living or visiting Singapore this must be visited,The collection is always changing but the items are really well displayed and labelled. The staff are very friendly and the shop has some great books and reference materials. I highly recommend visiting this museum.
Ingrid4711,291,May 2013,April 2013,50,Overwhelming amount of information,You do really need a lot of time to explore this museum properly. The is an overwhelming amount of information contained in a very large museum. The displays are stunning and interactive computer screens a great idea.
Bob1818296,12,May 2013,April 2013,40,A very interesting collection of artifacts.,We enjoyed our visit to the museum though we did feel that the signposting could have been a little better between exhibition areas as it was sometimes not clear where to go next.<br/><br/>Displays are generally very good and we found them interesting as well as informative
Jade M,34,May 2013,April 2013,40,It's ok,"Conveniently located downtown, this museum is a real gem. The Singapore Asian civilizations Museum is one of the finest museums of it's kind. Great sections on the settling of Singapore, and beautifully displayed galleries that feature different Asian cultures -- India, China, Thailand, etc."
Christina B,25,May 2013,April 2013,50,Insight into history and culture of Asia,"We visited the main building opposite of the Fullerton hotel, but there is also a second location of the museum in Armenian Street. <br/>The exhibition is beautifully presented, though a bit dark at times. On 3 floors you get a comprehensive overview about South East Asian and Chinese Culture as well as Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism. Try to catch the guided tour which takes about an hour to an hour and a half."
H5657,65,Apr 2013,February 2013,50,Amazing!,Extremely well presented. There was hardly anyone in there. It is definitely suitable for all ages. Need a couple fo hours but be selective.
jsteven8484,77,Apr 2013,April 2013,40,Nice museum,"Very nice museum in a good location in Singapore. Interesting exhibits, beautifully presented. Really convenient opening hours. You should catch the guided tour to benefit from the museum. You will learn many things about people habits, religions, culture and customs. This museum houses exhibits on several Asian areas not just Singapore, but many of the local area countries and religions"
Valerie037,879,Apr 2013,April 2013,50,A cultural experience of Asia,"To quote the ACM pamphlet this really is ""where asian cultures come alive!""  The gallery is set out over three levels, with each room offering an extensive collection of information and exhibits, from the history of Singapore, spice trade, religions, architecture and diverse communities with their  ancient histories and richly layered material cultures, plus much more."
Yichingchen,349,Apr 2013,April 2013,40,Good exhibition and comfortable place!,"The Museum is separated to seven little galleries which contains the differential culture in Asia. You may follow the suggested way to visit the whole museum or just find some specific gallery that you are interested in. The exhibition contains the stories of Singapore river, ancient Asia Buddhism culture and some culture in specific region like south Asia, West Asia...<br/>The museum also set lots of interactive screen for visitor to play to understand more about the exhibition. Overall it's a good museum that desereved you to spend times in here.<br/><br/>The adult price for tourist is 5 SGD per person. I went there by taking SMRT to Raffles places and go across to gavana bridge!"
nasus29,37,Apr 2013,March 2013,40,Interesting,Good museum and even better for us because we got free entrance. It was later in the day and a Sunday...maybe this was the reason why? Like so many museums in cities it tells their history and culture so worth a visit. It's not stuffy and easy and fairly quick to get round.
602Tony,424,Apr 2013,April 2013,50,A cultural adventure.,"We visit the ACM on every visit to Singapore. Each time there is a new, interesting and educational  special exhibition. The permanent exhibitions are always worth more than one visit, even just to see all that is on offer. Highly recommended."
Sharon4655,51,Apr 2013,April 2013,50,Amazing,"Interesting and amazing. Such great displays and extensive artefacts and so much to look at. Lots of interactive reading if that is your thing, or good to just look at for those in the group who aren't really interested. Great escape from the heat too."
Ann S,17,Apr 2013,April 2013,50,Interesting,"Take your time, it has a lot of info to digest. Lovely place to spend the morning or afternoon. Guided tour gives a detailed insist Ito some exhibits"
JCol75,54,Apr 2013,January 2013,50,New Years Eve at the Asian Civilisations Museum,"We had a great NYE at the Asian Civilisations Museum which was open all night and from memory had free entry.  Was great to walk around the surrounding areas and see in the New Year.  Very family friendly NYE activity, highly recommended"
BradJill,"125,640",Apr 2013,April 2013,40,Some civilisations missing but nice galleries overall!,"We recently visited the Asian Civilisations Museum (SG$5 per adult) and enjoyed our experience here, its well worth the time for those interested in learning about various regional cultures that influence and make-up Singapore's culturally mixed society.  <br/><br/>Interestingly, the museum name might be a bit misleading as only a handful of Asian civilisations are covered comprehensively in this museum, specifically those with important historical and present ties to modern day Singapore.  Remaining civilisations are not well represented, while others are simply left out.  However, the galleries you do see here are quite good. <br/><br/>The museum galleries are laid out well, displays are friendly with just the right amount of text.  There are plenty of monitors with audio, offering visitors more perspectives about people of the various cultures found in the museum.  The overall set-up is quite educational in this regard, making this a nice learning experience for younger people and those with keen interest in foreign cultures, heritage and people.  <br/><br/>We enjoyed the Singapore River exhibition and very good gallery space allocated to China and South Asia (primarily India).  We actually enjoyed the South Asia exhibits as much if not more than what we saw in the National Museum (India) visited in New Delhi earlier this year.  The gallery dedicated to Western Asia provided a decent introduction to Islam but was a bit spotty in its cultural representation.  <br/><br/>We found the SE Asian galleries to be somewhat incomplete.  There is adequate coverage of Malay heritage, some Thai, Khmer, Burmese and Indonesian but very limited Vietnamese and nothing regarding the Philippines.  This seemed a bit odd considering Singapore fits right in the center of SE Asia and it would have been quite decent of them to have included more cultural displays regarding its neighbouring ASEAN countries.  Also, interestingly, important civilisations like Korea and Japan are not found in the museum.  <br/><br/>Overall there seems to be room for improvement in terms of coverage of Asian civilisations, particularly with SE Asian neighbours.  Regardless, what you see here is quite good and worth your time and money.  In the end, we preferred the National Museum but found this to be a pretty good museum visit as well.  <br/><br/>Tip: For those seeking a more detailed historical account of Singapore itself, the National Museum is a better museum choice.  However, if you have the time, try to see both museums."
Paul W,278,Apr 2013,April 2013,50,BEAUTIFULLY PRESENTED,"Interesting exhibits, beautifully presented. Really convenient opening hours. Quiet and peaceful. Loved the Buddha images and Hindu statuary."
BFC51,121,Apr 2013,April 2013,40,Excellent museum,"We'd heard it was good, but hadn't expected it to be so detailed and informative. This is a must-see for anyone wanting to gain an overview of Asian cultures. The layout is a bit confusing and you can become overwhelmed by the amount of information, but stick with it."
Lozass,42,Apr 2013,September 2012,50,A lesson of eastern history and culture,"Great museum, located close the the marina Bay. The museum shows the history of Singapore and also good collections of key civilizations in Asia. Definitely is a must if you are into museums and history, especially for a western. Very recommended to spend about 3 hours for a good experience."
Maffradasher,64,Apr 2013,April 2013,50,"Oh wow, don't miss this.",What an amazing place!  Spent four hours just wandering around and admiring the most amazing pieces of work.  Also took part in a one hour free quided session.  Of course you can't learn much in one hour but enough to be able to pick out the statues of budda's - not as easy as you might think. It was also incredibly cool in the museum making it easy to wander around and enjoy.
alice b,50,Apr 2013,February 2013,50,Excellent museum,"The quality of the exhibit of this museum was fabulous. The lighting in the museum was a hindrance to trying to see the exhibits but what we were seeing was very interesting <br/>The location of the museum by the river added to its appeal for the views this presented. However, do not go to the ""restaurant "".   We wanted to sit and have a cold drink after seeing the museum and wandered into the attached restaurant.  Indochine is a picturesque overpriced restaurant and seems to be attached to the museum. Walk somewhere else for a drink or expect to be really overcharged   Fourteen dollars is too much to pay for sparkling water"
Alison B,341,Apr 2013,May 2012,50,Fascinating collections take time to look,"Excellently presented, this fascinating collection is worth more than a quick walk through.  Themed rooms help to give a real understanding and the benches provide a sit and look opportunity."
PaintProf,19,Apr 2013,December 2012,30,"Fascinating content, rather lifeless experience","Despite the wealth of cultural material, my visit took me back to my museum visits as a child- dark, rather difficult to relate to, and open only during office hours. It's probably sacrilegious to say this, but the ACM should take a page from Disney to design and delivery unforgettable experiences to visitors."
SnowmanSnipe,147,Apr 2013,April 2013,40,Fulfilling visit,"We learnt about this museum from the commentary on the Singapore river cruise. This museum is a gem. The admission is free to locals and PR holders but chargeable to foreign tourists at sgd8 per adult. It is beautifully maintained but the restrooms are located all the way (down the spiral stairs) in the basement.<br/><br/>We had a guided tour for the special exhibitions (Buddhism in south east Asia culture) and the tour guide was a volunteer guide who wore oddly loose pants, was super enthusiastic and had good knowledge of the exhibits. The guided tour was meant to last an hour, but our overly enthusiastic tour guide gave us commentary on everything (even to the reason for the ceiling fans in the foyer). Whilst we appreciated his knowledge and passion, some of his sharing felt repetitive and we left Midway through to observe the exhibits ourselves in peace and quiet sans the enthusiasm and corny jokes about participation and who can guess (insert here).<br/><br/>One constructive criticism is that the curator should do something about the guided tour timing.. We found the timing to be poorly structured because you can only choose to follow the guided tour for the permanent exhibits or the special exhibits since the timing for both overlap."
TimMPerth,313,Apr 2013,April 2013,50,Superb exhibits,"We had a few hours spare to check out this museum and were so glad that we did. It was filled with fascinating exhibit from all parts of Asia and parts of the middle east including fabric, metal work, weapons and other artifacts. The exhibit have excellent interpretive information so you can easily learn more about anything that interests you. We spent 2 hours and only saw about a third of the whole museum. It is also wonderful cool and dark inside, refreshing after the heat and brightness of wandering outside."
Una S,145,Apr 2013,March 2013,50,"Amazing little gem of a museum, just across from the Fullerton Hotel between Marina Bay and Boat Quay.","Excellent assortment of Asia artifacts, so many beautiful buddhas.  Very easy (an inexpensive) side trip if you are walking from Marina Bay to Boat Quay.  It was definitely worth the detour."
burgerqueen700,52,Apr 2013,March 2013,40,great way to spend a hot afternoon,Really enjoyed this museum. Would recommend taking a free tour. Admission discounted with singapore airline boarding pass
Jay H,209,Mar 2013,April 2012,40,The less-common among the many museums in the little Red Dot,"While singapore has no century-old long standing museums , all international art work, it focuses on things that it is good at...<br/><br/>For e.g. the ACM, has permanent exhibition on artifacts related to buddhism and other religions, nonetheless did not turn the place like a temple or religious venue...<br/>That is its magic!<br/><br/>A must-go for first timer and all Singaporeans...even my relative from Hong Kong picked this museum as the first choice when she re-visited Singapore recently..."
Judy H,9,Mar 2013,March 2013,50,Very informative!,"Spent several hours at this museum and learned so much about the history of the area!  The guards were really helpful and kind.  One showed me how to use an interactive map, which I had totally missed! It made the exhibit much more interesting!  They have some wonderful artifacts!"
shehnazlovestotravel,39,Mar 2013,March 2013,30,Average Museum,"To a Singaporean, it is an average museum. It may be a better experience for tourists though. They need to spruce the exhibits a little and bring in newer exhibits that would be of interest to everyone."
Mohitoswal,331,Mar 2013,March 2013,40,time well spent,very close to the marina this a a great place to spend a warm afternoon. 3 to 4 hours for history enthusiasts. great displays and informative.<br/>for smaller children i would recomend that they attend the storey telling sessions that happen free. a lost tradition: done very well.
FerrisXL,306,Mar 2013,March 2013,50,"Excellent museum, great presentation!","Conveniently located downtown, this museum is a real gem.<br/><br/>It's quite big so if you have the time I would recommend you pay various visits, picking out one or two areas each time since otherwise it is almost too overwhelming - so much information, so much to see.<br/><br/>A nice feature are the interactive screens in which individuals of each ethnic group explain certain apects of their society and culture.<br/><br/>The museum also has a nice restaurant/cafe with views of the Singapore river."
Lokman26,4,Mar 2013,March 2013,50,Definantly worthwhile to see when you're in Singapore,I walked in a was blown away how the set up was and how incredible the historical pieces are laid out. You walk around the museum and just get lost in al the greatness that south east Asia have given in the last centuries. I recommend everyone and go and see this magnificent museum when they are visiting Singapore.
Borisbear,63,Mar 2013,November 2012,50,Singapore’s best,"For my money, this is Singapore’s finest Museum, though the National Museum gives it a run for its money. It is what it says: a museum showcasing, through regularly changing exhibitions, the rich cultures of Asia that make up today’s Singapore. Set in a magnificent old Colonial Government Building, it sets out to be the best museum in Asia and to my mind it achieves this.<br/>The constantly changing exhibitions mean that you can visit every couple of months and still learn something.  Rather than take you through a chronological history, it focuses on themes. Interactive you want? It is here. Touch and feel? It is here. Information, guides and explanations? Here in abundance.<br/>What a wonderful place."
Khading,9,Mar 2013,March 2013,40,Awed by various unique exhibits,The collections itself made me awe-struck.<br/>Be sure to press on the right buttons nearby special displays. &gt;&lt;<br/>You'll see the items in a different light
MichaelOttawa_Canada,355,Mar 2013,March 2013,50,A must see in Singapore,"A fantastic collection of artifacts dating back from the 11th and 12th centuries. there was a special exhibit of buddhist art in Thailand, which was also excellent."
Resovoir,142,Mar 2013,February 2013,50,Very well organised,The organisation and electronic tablet is excellent for taking you through the various areas of the museum. I like the way the museum flowed from start to finish giving an indication in chronological order. If you are interested in differing cultures please go and learn the history and culture of Singapore
Ourdream2,591,Mar 2013,March 2013,40,Short journey and alot of information,"You should catch the guided tour to benfit from the museum. You will learn many things about people habits, religions, culture and customs. <br/>The best part for us was the Islamic culture, so simple, peaceful and great and rich in culture.<br/>Others cultures are good to know but alot of horror stories contain!!"
oxleyrise,58,Mar 2013,November 2012,50,Great international museum,"Well worth a 1/2 day visit. The Museum is located near the Singapore River, the CBD, and the Waterfront. Fascinating collection of multiple Asian countries' art and historical information."
UsaJules,448,Mar 2013,March 2013,40,Interesting Museum,The museum has lots to see.  Very extensive collections.  Very well maintained and nice facility.  Easy to find.
barbiegirl55,75,Mar 2013,December 2012,40,excellent museum,"Artifacts were very diverse,  really enjoyed the museum and displays.  Only disappointment was some of the displays were very dark,"
Marina V,173,Mar 2013,October 2012,50,Excellent,"I spent about 2 hours and loved it. If you are new to Asia or SE Asia, check it out. The museum has a great overview on most Asian populations and a great number of artifacts."
TravelWriterExm,82,Mar 2013,February 2013,40,Impressive,"We arrived just in time for the one-hour tour which helped us focus; otherwise, the museum might have been a bit overwhelming."
AlisonB683,82,Mar 2013,March 2013,40,A local gem,We enjoyed about an hour and a half here with a special exhibit from Thailand. It is an amazing gift to this community. The colonial architecture houses a wonderful expansive collection of Southeast Asian art and religious history.
Dietmar E,13,Mar 2013,October 2012,50,the best,"This was a lot better then any museum in the country, as they gave much local details. For me, it helped me to know the history that was attached to Singapore. There were artifacts and other collections that were much impressive."
durgaChicago,150,Mar 2013,NA,50,A 5 Star Experience,"The Singapore Asian civilizations Museum is one of the finest museums of it's kind. As an Asian Art Historian it was a pleasure to see the exhibits in such detail with so many splendid images representing South East Asia and South Asia. The textiles, ethnographic objects, painting and sculpture were displayed with very good signage in English. Explanations about the objects with their dates and composition were accompanied by many audio/visual stations for further explanations. The only drawback was the low level of light which is necessary to keep the integrity of the objects. I was glad that I brought a small flashlight to read the signage. The small, compact museum shop was worth a visit."
SharonCapeCod,75,Mar 2013,February 2013,50,Really nice Asian-themed museum,"Great sections on the settling of Singapore, and beautifully displayed galleries that feature different Asian cultures -- India, China, Thailand, etc.  My only disappointment was that many of the galleries were poorly lit.  I know light is a particularly difficult issue for museums in order to preserve the artifacts, but I have been in many museums and this one was definitely under lit.  Signage was very well done and quite educational."
bakermob,"1,974",Feb 2013,February 2013,50,Interesting and Informative,"An interesting museum that sheds some light on Singapore history and culture. Worth a walk through. Again, y husband could spend hours here."
ms_ayu96,549,Feb 2013,NA,30,Nice museum,Never knew going to the historical museum will be this intresting. Singapore government sure take things seriously when it comes to tourism.
Jonas P,260,Feb 2013,February 2013,40,Great museum on Asian culture &amp; religion,"Another great Singapore museum, even though I'd rate National Museum of Singapore even higher.<br/><br/>Exhibitions give a great opportunity to learn more about Asia, but requires some concentration and focus."
Mehran_2008,107,Feb 2013,February 2013,50,Insightful,This museum helps you to have a better insight about the culture and civilizations of Asian countries. Take it as a learning opportunity and you will enjoy it.
Allan and Susan H,54,Feb 2013,February 2013,50,Very interesting,"The culture and history of the Asian community and their diversity, was very informative - as is their culture of segregating their children in their education."
MatthewS4,164,Feb 2013,February 2013,40,Nice museum,"Very nice museum in a good location in Singapore. This museum houses exhibits on several Asian areas not just Singapore, but many of the local area countries and religions. Worthy of a trip to visit. They offer guided tours which I did not partake in but think it would have been better had I."
Glen R,29,Feb 2013,February 2013,40,Welcome Surprise find in the rain.,We thought it was just something to do in a downpour but when we decided to call in to see this Museum we were surprised by the depth of information in the displays.  The artifacts also are incredible.  We came out with a much wider viewpoint and understanding of religions and cultures.  This is a must do on your trip if you have a few days in Singapore.  I believe there is a fee to enter but we were there on a public holiday and it was free as was the National Museum.
Mira J,29,Feb 2013,August 2012,30,A bit difficult to find from the MRT,"I was there when they had the wedding dress exhibition, that was good. Tourist have to pay but it was worth it, I learnt a lot about the history, culture, politics etc. and it was air conditioned! The staff there very friendly esp the security guard. Eat before you go there, as there are only 1 cafe and 1 small chinese restaurant (very dissapointed with them as they did not let me and my hungry baby in to sit down and eat) There is a food centre near by though, cheap too - the security guard told me about it."
chrichen,277,Feb 2013,January 2013,50,Explore the arts culture heritage of South East Asia,"During my longer stay in Singapore for Christmas I decided to visit the Asian civilisations museum located 5 minutes by walking distance from The Raffles Place. Huge classical construction along the singapore river. At that time  there were two very interesting exhibitions, specially one showing us the influences of Buddhist art in Thailand civilisations like Ayuthhaia, Sukhothai and Lan. Great exhibition with extraordinary master pieces such as sculptures, ceramics, paintings, textiles etc... real treasures  in an excellent museum presenetation. As  european citizen fond of arts it was for me a discovery of the Southeasia artistic heritage. Just fascinating !"
HansvandeBunte,106,Feb 2013,November 2012,40,"Great objects, small exhibitions and lovely location","The high end quality of the objects, the displays and comfortable guidedance through its exhibitions is a great pleasure. i would visit it again. The restaurant serves fantistic food but is on the pricy side."
Su H,65,Feb 2013,February 2013,50,Take the time,"The museum covers a lot of ground - in both content and floor space. We tackled just part of the 1st floor so we weren't overwhelmed by information.<br/>The exhibition on the Singapore River was well laid out. I recommend taking the time to read the large-format books that accompany the displays. There""s a wealth of information to be found in their pages. <br/>The exhibition of cultural items curated on the basis of media (e.g. gold, cloth) was fascinating, particularly the intricate metalwork. <br/>The ""samples"" of various Asian cultural groups (e.g. Bataks) allowed us to better appreciate the great diversity in the region.<br/>We are looking forward to our return visit to check out more of the offerings."
themkc,34,Feb 2013,February 2013,40,Don't try to do it all in one visit,"This museum's collection is impressive, make no mistake. The artifacts are all well maintained and displayed, and the entry price is very affordable (SG$8 for an adult, SG$4 for concession). However at times I felt as though the museum lacked a clear narrative in its exhibitions, which made it difficult to absorb the message that each of the eight galleries were trying to give, without having to read each and every info card. I tried doing this and a few galleries in it was getting tiring, and attempting to skim through information made it difficult to appreciate the museum.<br/><br/>I'd recommend you come into the museum with pick of two or three of the galleries that you'd most want to cover (separated into ethinicities). From there, I think the experience would be much more compelling.<br/><br/>P.S. I management is reading this, the museum at times is very dark. I appreciated the ambiance that is created but for a person with 20/20 vision, there were definitely times when the lighting was almost non-existant and information difficult to read."
cihara,20,Feb 2013,January 2013,50,State of the Art Museum,"Very well planned, high tech museum.  Give yourself plenty of time if you want to make the most of all the computer information."
BauerDeutsch,10,Feb 2013,March 2012,50,Definitive,A great interactive cultural museum.  And don't miss as well the Singapore National Museum (worth a day if you are really interested in the history and cultural development of Singapore).
IraP,143,Feb 2013,January 2013,40,More of an Art Museum,"This is a very good museum which is housed in a beautiful historic building right on the Singapore River near Raffle's landing spot.  It covers a wide range of Asian cultures and just touches upon each of them.  I thought the museum would be a little more historical in nature, but it basically consisted of art objects, statutes, mask, manuscripts and artifacts.  In this sense, I thought it more of a history of civilizations through art and was more of an art museum.  In fact, it reminded me quite a bit of the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. <br/><br/>There is quite a bit to see, but fortunately there is a very nice restaurant associated with the museum where you can take a break and eat overlooking the Singapore River.  The food was pretty good, although i did have a fairly strange hamburger.  But that is the fun of traveling.  If you have a Singapore Airlines boarding pass, admission is half off the S$10 charge. A pleasant way to spent a rainy afternoon, or anytime if you are interested in learning about Asian cultures."
Nia01,311,Jan 2013,January 2013,50,Good collections,Ticket price is reasonable SGD 8. They give you free guide who was knowledgeable so you would be satisfied. The museum itself is nice
ShawnV,39,Jan 2013,September 2012,50,"Amazing place, a must see",My my wife and I stopped off in singapore whilst on honeymoon and decided to visit this museum whilst waiting for a friend. We were blown away by the collections and scale of the place. It feels like you could walk all day and not get to all the exibits. I learnt alot about the history of place!
TazjnMing,125,Jan 2013,January 2013,50,Larger than expected,This had a wonderful exhibition of the river development in Singapore and the indigenous people. The foreign colonization by the British and eventual independence was well explained. Other exhibits were very interesting and showed the diversification of the current populous.
Helen D,8,Jan 2013,January 2013,50,Great to learn more about this unique cultural mix.,This building stands out and has remarkable prescence. The displays and information within do help a visitor have a better understanding of the amazing cultural mix and how it all came about. A must see.
fbldebs,90,Jan 2013,January 2013,40,Interesting.....,I'm not a great lover of museums but have to say that this was well worth a couple of hours of my time!  Lots of interesting things to see - go visit
Brenda C,216,Jan 2013,NA,50,A unique museum that guides you through Asian civilization,"Exhibits are nicely displayed and tell a good story. If you are interested in more details, the interactive screen displays are useful.  (For example I was fascinated by the water puppets of Hanoi, the batik dyeing and the Thai silk weaving processes.) We've been to famous  museums around the world with their large treasure collections, but this one is unique in its focus, and you can get through all the galleries without feeling overwhelmed. Admission is $8 and senior concession $4 - good value."
mai_wat,2,Jan 2013,January 2013,50,This is awesomee,They have a lot precious things I've ever seen before. I can stay in there whole day!! and staffs are nice they help us a lot and give us a best Singapore map because the map that i got from airport is suck:(
Gregorius Suharsono,"1,286",Jan 2013,NA,40,Great collection and well displayed,"Its one of the best museum in South East Asia. Great collection, well preserved, good lighting and information. I wish more museum about Asian will be like this one."
ACTravel_12,17,Jan 2013,January 2013,40,Great airconditioned museum,Woud recommend a walk around Clarke Quay and boat Quay followed by a stroll through the museum. Great exhibits (If Museums are your thing especially) and very informative. A delightful reprieve from teh heat too!
DiveMom,37,Jan 2013,July 2012,50,A Beautiful Taste of ALL Asian Countries,"Very well curated and labeled artifacts from all over Asia.<br/><br/> The Chinese pottery, antique jewelry and the Japanese kimonos were particular favorites."
MartPold,16,Jan 2013,January 2013,50,Great place for knowledge,In the beginning you get an overview of Singapore's history. Which is the followed by exhibitionism about different parts of Asia. Wish we had more time to spend there..
2NO-mad,216,Jan 2013,August 2012,40,Great place for learning about Singapore,"If you want to learn some about the history of Singapore, this is the place to go to.  The museum is well-built and proportional.  The exhibition is well-organized and explained.  I think it could be better, but this is the best you can get in Singapore."
Merran S,33,Jan 2013,October 2012,40,Lovely building and museum,Great museum with changing exhibitions in an easy to access area of Singapore. Everything is well laid out and sufficient informaton provided. There is also a nice restaurant within the complex.
Heather G,91,Jan 2013,January 2013,30,Take your time,This Museum is mind boggling. Enjoyed the use of interactive touch screens to learn more but came away with more questions than answers -- such is the varied interwoven cultural threads that make up Singapore.
ChubbyFoodie,37,Jan 2013,August 2012,50,Great Museum,"This is a great museum to visit with interactive tools. Look out for interesting exhibitions that come and go. Probably one of the best museums I have been to - in the world. Unlikely find in Singapore but nonetheless, here it is!"
Shirley T,119,Jan 2013,December 2012,40,Modern Museum,"We arrived only 30 minutes before closing time (the museum closes at 7 p.m.). The museum attendants refused our payment, saying that the complete tour would take at least 1.5 hours so our money would be wasted (the ticket was SGD 8 per person). They allowed us to take a sneak peak so we tried to walk as much as we could within 20 minutes. We loved what we saw, the museum is well organized, all objects have adequate description which is very helpful.<br/><br/>When the time allows, we would like to come back and do a proper tour."
CompassWhistle,579,Jan 2013,NA,50,Fascinating.,"Give yourself plent of time to see this fascinating collection of Southeast Asian artifacts. It's quite large and there is so much information to absorb. We made the mistake of going late Friday afternoon after a day of sightseeing, and we were physically and mentally exhausted after spending just 1.5 hours here (I wish they offered multi-day passes so we could see the rest another day). Lots of insight into eastern religion, art and lifestyles. Well-worth the $8 admission fee, but if you go between 6 and 9 pm Fridays, the price is $4."
cbe28,17,Jan 2013,December 2012,50,Not to be missed,This is one of my favourite museums in the world. A wonderful collection of Asian and Singaporean history. Its a cool oasis by the Singapore river with a wonderful view over the Singapore river and the Fullerton Hotel.<br/><br/>It also has a lovely shop with quality souvenirs. <br/><br/>Stop for a snack and cold drink at Indochine while you are there.
Cecilia F,5,Jan 2013,December 2012,50,Asian Civilisations Museum,So informative - especially about SE Asia and teh diverse religious influences and histories. . I also liked the displays of the history of the Singapore River. You could spend a day there - the cafe is lovely too.
DenisWm,46,Jan 2013,December 2012,40,Well worth a visit,"I was pulled around the museum by my lively, Singapore based, 7.5 year old granddaughter at great speed, what's this, what's that? Not stopping to listen the granfather's boring explanation. Next time we'll allow more time."
LarRanTravels,635,Jan 2013,February 2012,50,Must see...,Very informative with excellent exhibits. Housed in a beautiful building. Allow at least 3 hours.  Avoid the elevator; very slow!
Yayi W,105,Jan 2013,December 2012,50,Not to be missed!,the collections are just great. well-displayed and very informative. It tells you the history of Asia in general and of course how Singapore has developed from Temasek to the current Singapore.
Geoff W,40,Dec 2012,June 2012,50,History Outlined,"Excellent exhibits. Could easily spend a whole day in this very well run museum. The lift is painfully slow though, and intended for health reasons use only."
Howard H,28,Dec 2012,October 2012,50,One of the great Asian museums,"A very large museum set in a classic colonial building. Not too huge to easily see in a few hours. We were lucky, I suppose, since when we entered the museum we were the only people in the lobby except for the information person and a docent. Without our even having to inquire, the docent, a beautiful and very intelligent young Chinese woman, came over to us and asked us if we would like to take a free, private tour! How could we say no??<br/><br/>Our docent spoke perfect English and was incredibly knowledgable, so she explained the exhibits in depth. I kept interrupting her with questions, as I was thirsting for more knowledge as we went. I apologized for asking so many questions, and she graciously said she not only had no problem, but that she was happy I was so interested. We had a little time at the end and talked about our families and lives a bit. If I had thought of it I would have asked for her contact information, as my wife and I both felt like we would become good friends.<br/><br/>After the tour, we had a light lunch in their extremely beautiful, serene and reasonably-priced restaurant, which sits right on the Singapore river. <br/><br/>Unless you don't like museums and are not interested in the history and culture of where you are in the world, this is not to be missed!"

Having been to countless museums all over the world, this isn't my favorite, but it is very nice and if Asian artwork, statues, and artifacts are your thing, then this is your place."

Peek,5,Dec 2012,NA,50,Excellent for Southeast Asian exhibits,"Excellent exhibits covering the various cultures in Southeast Asia with well-written notes and narratives accompanying artefacts. Travelling exhibitions staged here are usually very good too, although the crowds can be a bit of a damper."
GroningenCopenhagen,924,Dec 2012,November 2012,50,Very nice museum visit,"This museum was helpful en many ways; it not only cover regional developments in civilisation taking a pan-Asian perspective, but also tells key words about how Singapore actually developed itself. The very central location near the river makes it easy to ""do"" on your walk around town. Note they are closed Monday mornings, but open all weekdays until 7 PM (Friday 9 PM)."
Jana C,"3,637",Dec 2012,January 2012,40,Great museum,"This place is a short walk from Clark Quay, looks lovely when lit up at night. The museum is very informative about history of Singapore and other Asian countries."
alamo25,75,Nov 2012,November 2012,40,"Hidden gem, art &amp; history combined","Not far from Boat Quay, this museum has cheap entry and several floors of South East Asian arts, textiles, crafts and history. Countries include: Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, India. Especially interesting is the Islamic arts display with handpainted Qur'ans that are over 500 years old."
Crono_Ng,27,Nov 2012,October 2012,50,You shouldn't miss this attraction,"A great deal of cultural and historical information and facts from most of South East Asia, China and India. Impressive collection of buddhism sculptures and the one that really got to my attention is stories about the various Indian deities. Definitely a must visit place for cultural and historical fanatics!"
SallyVernon1985,7,Nov 2012,April 2012,50,Culture Hit,"Fantastic and beautiful exhibits, highlighting the different cultures that make Singapore so diverse. Great place to head on a rainy day. Check the times for the free tours, the guides are informative and you'll learn some interesting new facts."
Teekeon,165,Nov 2012,August 2012,50,A must go,Underrated place...  The peranakan Display is amazing and well presented. Singapore should have more places like this !
Chris F,77,Nov 2012,May 2012,50,Culture without colonialism,"Singapore is so international that you could almost forget it's in Asia. This museum is an elegant attempt to present Singapore as something more than a bustling conglomeration of foreign interests and commerce. There are some fine examples of classical Chinese art displayed in a serene (fashionably dark) modern setting. The range of artefacts from other Asian countries is very good. It's a small, but impressively sophisticated museum."
Leesa D,382,Nov 2012,October 2012,50,Fascinating!,Really lovely museum with great stories about the early migrants to Singapore. A real history lesson and definitely would recommend it.
rjasmin,169,Nov 2012,NA,50,Impressed with the extensive exhibits,"I was there recently for the Islamic Arts from SEA exhibitions and was really impressed with the collections. There were also other exhibits on other religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism on display.  And I was delighted to see the other south east Asian collections too. For a small admission fee, this is a real treat worth every cent of it."
Ropongi,288,Nov 2012,October 2012,40,For a rainy day,"The museum basically comprises the first floor of this central building. It contains collections of objects from most of the ethnic groups that inhabit Singapore: they are nicely displayed, with some interactive exhibits."
Jamie S,8,Nov 2012,October 2012,40,very nice museum,"I liked this museum. A nice collection, especially if you are interested in the many different facets of ""asian"" history. No audio guides as of yet, but at times throughout the museum there are screens with headphones where you can watch a short clip and those are informative and interesting<br/><br/>easy to go here for a short while (only $8) when you are visiting Marina Sands and the Merlion"
Andrew U,160,Nov 2012,NA,40,Eye opening,"The Asian Civilisations museum is housed in a beautiful 19th century building close to the Singapore river. It covers the history of Asia from prehistoric times to the present day and shows the complex and dynamic relationships between the various civilisations that spread and contracted across the region.<br/><br/>Some of the lower galleries deal with the history of Singapore and its place in South-east Asia and the later galleries examine the development of agriculture and the expansive, complex Bronze age cultures. Exhibits range from stone carvings, architecture, statues and idols, weapons and jewellery.<br/><br/>When we visited the museum there was a great exhibition about the influence of Islam in Asia and the influences it brought to local civilisations.<br/><br/>One criticism relates to the lack of interactivity in the exhibits. While well presented the various displays are very ""old school"" and are likely to be of little interest to younger visitors or those who don't enjoy peering at placards. An audio tour would be of great benefit as would more direction as to which order the galleries should be viewed in. We seemed to jump forwards and backwards thousands of years at one point and missed the narrative of the displays as a result.<br/><br/>Be prepared to spend many hours in the museum - it is a great deal larger than it appears from the front. Overall the museum is well worth a visit. If you only have a few days, or are on your first visit to Singapore then the National Museum is more concise and a better introduction to local culture."
StrategyIdeas,36,Nov 2012,September 2012,50,The winds are the reason why Singapore is a global hub,"The Asian Civilizations Museum has excellent exhibits, good specials and some very interesting docents. The best docent who showed me around explained to me how the winds blew, and how they made Singapore the logistics and trading hub it has become. If you care to know more pay the ACM a visit. <br/><br/>The website has all the details visit it at www.acm.org.sg"
Woci,160,Nov 2012,November 2012,50,Best collection in the world of little seen southeast Asian artifacts,"An amazing array of specialized exhibits which show the history and artistic/craft differences among different parts of Asia, with particularly exotic artifacts from different parts of the Borneo/Sumatra area.  Really taught me about the milllenia old history of empires and achievement in those areas which have since been overshadowed by other influences.  Eye opening.  The only down side is that the gift shop, which used to be a quite extensive place to buy art, has downsized and you have to go to the Singapore National Art Museum for a smaller selection than used to exist here."
Wandering_Noldo,44,Nov 2012,October 2012,50,"A very handsome museum, classic","Impressive display of cultural heritage of India, China and various south-east asian cultures. Good display of the historical development of rice growing, and of the spread of Islam. Interesting to see asian culture from another angle where Russia and the Middle East are largely missing."
soche,464,Oct 2012,October 2012,50,Excellent,"The museum is behind Fullerton hotel and next to the Victoria Theatre where there is a Sir Stamford Raffles statue in front of it. Across the river, it is central business area where skyscrapers are all over. country there where history is self explanatory plus more. Very well presented and artifacts. Highly recommended if one likes to have some knowledge of south east Asia. Also, it is worth a visit on a rainy day"
trowly167,5,Oct 2012,July 2012,30,Worth a look on a rainy day,This is a museum with a few interesting exhibits but it is a bit old-fashioned and feels like it has been left behind by the whizz-bang technology seen elsewhere in Singapore. Nevertheless it is a good source of information about the history of Singapore and Asia and as such is worth a visit on a rainy day.
Stella L,36,Oct 2012,October 2012,40,Take a free guided tour with your visit,"But be prepared to be on your feet for approx. 1.5 hours. At the beginning of our tour, we had to quickly follow the guide up a flight of stairs to the 2nd floor. There wasn't any place to rest as she moved quickly from one exhibit to another. However, she provided us with a wealth of information about the different religions in the Asian regions. We would not have learned as much if we were on our own reading the exhibit descriptions. We went back to some of the exhibits that we missed after our tour.<br/><br/>Tips: get a 50 percent discount if you show a current Singapore Airlines boarding pass; pay 50 cents to rent a locker for your bags so you don't have to lug them around the museum."
PMO44,24,Oct 2012,October 2012,50,A truly educational experience.,"Well displayed, unhurried, not crowded (on the day we went, a Sunday). I'll be back again when I have more time."
bingyibing,6,Oct 2012,October 2012,50,Asian History at Glance,"Best place to have a quick glance on Asian Civilisation, History and Culture.  It took about 3 hours to cover all the halls but worth the time spent. Nice clean place."
Crescentra,921,Oct 2012,October 2012,40,Aga Khan exhibit - good but relatively small scale,"The museum is behind fullerton hotel (the museum building used to be the immigration department when I was very young) - and next to the Victoria Theatre where there is a Sir Stamford Raffles statue in front of it (all taxi drivers should know the area else they should not be on the road) Across the river, it is central business area where skyscrapers are all over.<br/><br/>I was there for - Treasures of the Aga Khan Museum: Architecture in Islamic Arts<br/>It was a pretty good exhibit though smaller than I had imagined.<br/><br/>In general it is a nice museum and for the size of the country - it is very well setup and run.<br/>I had never tried to cover the whole place in one day and pick your interests and should be worth a visit if you enjoy museum."
jonnylouiss,7,Oct 2012,August 2012,40,cheap and nice,"Low price ! Lots of things to see,  clothes,  items they use to eat. Clothes they wear for festival,  colour shoes, !"
ALKEW,39,Oct 2012,March 2012,50,Worth a visit,"Most contemporary museum you would find, a lot of informations and audio guide. Plenty of history and cultures could be found here."
Lynn T,108,Oct 2012,October 2012,50,My favorite museum in Singapore,I have been to the museum countless times. Took many friends visiting the country there where history is self explanatory plus more.  Very well presented and artifacts even attracts kids.  Highly recommended if one likes to have some knowledge of south east Asia
AugusBagus,118,Oct 2012,November 2011,40,Get to know the true culture of south east asia,It is not always easy to access the local culture in ultramodern Singapore. Asian Civilisation Museum is a truly unique place for that.<br/><br/>You don't find here a lot of old and valuable relics but you do have really great exhibits about old Singaporean and pan-Asean tribes and their cultures.<br/><br/>Fascinating insights and really accessible
AndThePea,55,Oct 2012,October 2012,40,Good if you can get there.,"We set off by taxi from Swissotel The Stamford for this museum. Sure we could have walked, but it is hot in Singapore! Unfortunately, our taxi driver had never heard of this museum and was also unable to find the entry to Empress Place - it is a one way street. He dropped us off when he felt we were somewhere near and we had to walk the rest of the way. If you find yourself in this situation you can ask to go to the Fullerton Hotel - walk through the lobby and out the other side of the hotel - the museum is just over the bridge. Do not buy drinks at the hotel.<br/><br/>This museum is very well presented. It is probably too much for one visit so just pick and choose the areas in which you have an interest - or come back the next day! We had a 9 year old and 11 year old with us and they found it quite interesting, especially the interactive displays. Good value for money - we got a discount when we explained the trouble we had finding the museum!"
Asian_Wanderer888,"1,206",Oct 2012,September 2012,50,One of a kind,"I have been twice to the museum in one week because I could not manage to see it all. It contains one of the best collections all over Asia. Great collections on Buddhist, Hindu or Muslim items. There are also changing shows and the Museum often organizes themes and events which are in itself worth to see and explore. A great way to spend a rainy or just humid day, or to combine it with a tour to Marina Bay."
Stephen L,545,Oct 2012,October 2012,50,Only one complaint...,"...and that is the crass font used outside for the name, it's so un-asian. Interesting exhibits and good for a few hours."
Nurikabe_12,684,Oct 2012,October 2012,40,Excellent attraction - for scholars,"If you've a keen interest in asian civilization, this place is good to see.<br/><br/>The exhibits are splendid, and comprehensive in scope. There are many interactive displays, and at the time of my visit there were guides/volunteers at some sections.<br/><br/>This place is huge however, and not advisable to visit if you're in a hurry to see as much of Singapore as you can. It would take at least a full day and early evening (minimum) to go through and decently appreciate all the exhibits. I'd suggest the better way to see this place is to plan several visits (lasting 2-3 hrs each) and go thorough several sections at a time so you can fully ""digest"" everything.<br/><br/>Not recommended if you're with children and teenagers though - more likely they'd be bored to death. This is through no fault of the Museum though, it's just that kids and teens probably have different interests.<br/><br/>If you're on a tight schedule however, and want to involve Singaporean cross cultural exchange in your travels, I'd recommend the Singapore National Museum instead as an good alternative."
The_Pale_Ridah,"2,013",Oct 2012,August 2012,50,"Ancient kingdoms, forgotten gods, SE Asia in a nutshell.","Many world museums with Asian exhibitions usually feature boring pottery &amp; Chinese tea cups, I’m pretty sure the kids want to see precious gold, jewels, swords &amp; statues of gods &amp; super beings, all the stuff that captures the imagination. The Asian Civilisation Museum is full of this stuff with a special emphasis on the SE Asian region &amp; less about China &amp; its teacups, making this museum unique with its specific collection, mostly donated from wealthy benefactors who either stole them or purchased them so cheaply from locals it is almost like stealing.  <br/><br/>Some of the more impressive artefacts are a 2500 year old Dong Son bronze drum from Northern Vietnam, in almost perfect condition, it is intricately detailed created by a mysterious people who invented Bronze technology independently from Europeans. The Jewellery section has exotic pieces that could easily be worn to any Hollywood party today. Big kids might like the strange swords on display with jewel encrusted scabbards &amp; handles typical of the sultans &amp; Princes of Java. Another fascinating artefact is a genuine Islamic astrolabe, a contraption that guided traders thousands of kilometres across deserts &amp; mountains from West Asia to the East via the stars, a beautiful piece of ancient technology accompanied by an interactive video to explain its workings. The museum has loads of statues of different religions &amp; gods from around the SE Asian region making it a repository of religious icons, surely this place would make many suicide-bombers nervous, leave your vests at home. <br/><br/>One of the best features of the museum is the grand colonial building it occupies. Formerly the administrative heart of Singapore, within its tall walls it exudes an old world charm &amp; atmosphere of the colony’s past grandeur from the polished floorboards to the grand columns, fitting for a place that displays the glorious past of some of the regions finest ancient artwork for future generations. <br/><br/>Entry for adults is $8, the museum also accepts foreign university cards for student concessions at half price. Friday 5 – 7pm is half price on all tickets. Its less than 5mins walk to the Raffles Place MRT station, just behind the Victoria Concert Hall bus stand on Fullerton road &amp; across the bridge from the 5-star Fullerton hotel. There are free daily guided tours at different times each day. The daily 7pm close time is perfect as the museum is surrounded by the Boat Quay restaurant precinct."
piphoshin,171,Oct 2012,October 2012,50,One of my Favourite Museums,"This was my second visit to the museum and I only spent an hour and a half in it, as opposed to the half day I did on my first visit, but it was still brilliant.  Its located in a wonderful old colonial building and has a fantastic collection.  Its a great way to quickly familiarise yourself with the region.<br/>Being my second visit, what jumped out was the tremendous cultural contribution of the Indonesian islands to the Region.  Its easy to believe that the Chinese and Indian influence is all pervasive.  But Indonesia's different ethnic groups offer so much more depth.  Unfortunately the collection stops at Maluku, presumably seeing the Papuan Melonesian tribes as being the scopre of the collection.<br/>The collection of Muslim art is absolutely fantastic and probably its best attraction.  I love the Arabian ambience that's available in one of the rooms.<br/>When it gets too hot to walk around Singapore get yourseld down to this museum for half a day it won't disappoint."
Dekakuri,41,Oct 2012,March 2012,50,One of my Favorite Museums,"Whether it's for a special exhibition or just a day out to take a look at the permanent collections, a day to the ACM is always a treat. The colonial building that houses it is just lovely and the collections are expansive and gorgeous. Not to be missed if you are in Singapore."
HorstHH,8,Oct 2012,NA,40,Very good and worth the effort. ,"Very good display of various artefacts and description of these. The guided tour can be annoying if a large group of people are led, especially if you go on your own as space between some exhibits is limited. A progression route would be useful for the self guided."
Annwang923,39,Sep 2012,August 2012,50,The museum you must see,I visited it on Friday evening coz it's half price. Not too many people at that time so I can enjoy it with myself. Exhibitions are very wonderful and worth you to spend 2 hours in it. But I was always thinking why there are no gallery of Japan and Korea? Strange...
G M,226,Sep 2012,September 2012,50,Must Visit,"Great museum, make sure you set aside 90 minutes to see everything. Well worth the time. Also stop by the cafe, it's right on the river, great for coffee and tea,."
Stuart W,18,Sep 2012,September 2012,40,Very good,"A good exhibition, well presented and informative and value for money at only $S8 for an adult. Also close to the F1 track if you need time to burn whilst waiting for the race to start."
l1nda1,88,Sep 2012,August 2012,40,Singapore culture revealed,"I really like the way that the ACM puts Singapore culture into context. I gave 4 stars bearing in mind the guided tour daily every day at 11 excluding Monday. There are afternoon tours as well, so check the website. The docents who lead the tour really make the museum come to life and are wonderful and charming guides with lots of fascinating tid bits of information.<br/><br/>Without a guided tour, you may not gain the same understanding of Peranakan culture since a bit more written information and interactive displays could be helpful. None the less, if you are only in Singapore for a short time and want to have some background - this is a good place to start.<br/><br/>If you want to try Peranakan food, True Blue restaurant a just down the street has a lovely ambiance and good food. It would be considered a bit pricey by locals but it is charming and convenient if you a here for a short time.<br/><br/>The museum is in a lovely old building, previously a school.  It is cozy and well worth a visit!"
Sharon.Edge,66,Sep 2012,December 2011,50,A great experience,"You could quite easily spend a large chunk of your day here, there's so much to see. Apart from the historical facts and exhibits, which alone are extremely insightful, there is usually an exhibition which somehow manages to have something to interest everyone.There is also a lovely restaurant, where you can sit outside and view the quay (prices very reasonable) and a really good shop as well. And don't miss the nearby world- famous Raffles statue!"
nanitumlos,58,Sep 2012,September 2012,50,A Great Way to Spend the Morning,"we inadvertently arrived just in time for a guided tour of the SouthEast Asian part of the museum. our guide was very informative and entertaining and credible. we wandered around the museum for about an hour. it was really great, especially for history-buffs like us. (and we got in for free!)"
Nadir A,188,Sep 2012,August 2012,40,If you like history GO!,"I was a lot impressed by this Museum, even I saw a lot in my life. First of all, I like the building, constructed in colonial style. The most impressive are the rooms reflecting the life of different Asian communities, e.g. Arabian style and others. <br/>I am very passionate about hitory, for this reason I like it too much.<br/>For sure, this museum is one of the most attractive places of the town.<br/>Don't hesitate and visit, worth."
Kevin C,72,Sep 2012,July 2012,50,Worth a visit if you have the time,"A good way to spend a couple of hours if your trip allows for it. The museum always has 'travelling' exhibits and some of them are fantastic. I try to get to see most of them. It is a great alternative or escape from the rigours of shopping and running around.  I've never come across any BAD museum in Singapore, Fort Silo is also excellent as it the small one in Raffles Hotel."
windance,287,Sep 2012,September 2012,50,A must,"Skip the Singapore National Museum (over-hyped by the government and dull) and go directly here.  It's an old colonial building that is worth seeing in its own right.  Exhibits on the spread of various Asian religions and cultures are informative and fascinating.  I learned more about Buddhism and Islam in an afternoon here than I thought possible.  It's a larger museum than you might think, so plan on several hours.  I visited on Monday afternoon and it was free.  Great to combine with cocktails, or a bite at the restaurants along the adjacent quay."
HellsBells747,14,Sep 2012,August 2012,40,Very interesting,Very affordable entry fee ($8). Great displays providing really interesting history of the different cultures that make up South East Asia.
faisalmd,191,Sep 2012,July 2012,50,Amazingly Designed and Organised,"ASM is a very attractive museum housed in a wonderful colonial era building and an oasis for museum lovers! It certainly has excellent historical gatherings from all over South East Asia (Malay, Singaporean, Thai etc.); South Asia(Pakistani, Indian, Sri Lankan). Recently there was an exhibition on Aga Khan Arts which housed a lot of calligraphic work."
Bob S,499,Sep 2012,September 2012,40,Very Interesting,"The visit to the museum was a part of a tour we did with Singapore East Tours. <br/>Our guide was well versed with the history of Singapore and what was displayed in the Museum. This made our visit to the Museum very interesting, in particular the history of the establishment of Singapore from the beginning."
butterandjelly,247,Sep 2012,August 2012,40,Take the tour!,"I am not much of a museum goer but I very much enjoyed the free tour that we took here.  Our guide (wish I recalled his name) was full of energy and enthusiasm, which drew all of us in.  This is a great option to keep in your back pocket if you need relief from the heat and/or rain."
Nossi,254,Sep 2012,August 2012,30,Not all that clear,"Seemed to lack structure. Appeared to contain lots of individual bits and pieces, but we failed to pick up a common thread which we had hoped would have enhanced our understanding of Asian Civilisations."
Magussevrier,94,Sep 2012,August 2012,50,A view of the past,"We joined a free guided English tour that explained in depth the significance of many of the exhibits, the tour is only one and a half hours so we took a further 4 hours to try to view this magnificent display of Asian Civilisation."
John P,141,Sep 2012,February 2012,50,Everything you need know about Asia,This museum is very large and very fascinating. It surveys comprehensively the many peoples of Asia and their contributions to civilisation. You need at least 3 hours to do it justice and there is so much to learn that 2 visits a day or so apart are best. Some beautiful exhibits
Sue_Decco,14,Sep 2012,February 2012,30,"Right beside the river, came for the cheap exhibition","mostly cheap exhibitions inside the building. not a very big place, but fully air-con, a good getaway from the hot weather outside. Exhibition contents vary depending on which things are on displayed."
chiara5775,142,Sep 2012,October 2011,30,A bit lacking in content,Impressive building right on the canal but the exhibit content a bit lacking. Still a great way to spend a hot afternoon in Singapore followed by a nice cold drink across the river at Boat Quay.
Marco C,574,Sep 2012,August 2012,50,Excellent,"A complete overview of Asian art. China, Western Asia, South-East Asia, South Asia are all given separate sections. Lots of interesting exhibits and friendly staff to guide you through. They even lend you magnifying glasses to see the details of the miniatures. There are also guided tours at various times of the day. I had an excellent one-hour English tour at 2pm which led me through the whole museum: it was a but rushed but then I stayed on and went through the exhibits at my own pace. Not to be missed!"
bornasdragonfly,50,Sep 2012,August 2012,30,Islamic archtecture museum,"I liked to know about how the culture formulated and embraced from Chinese, malaysian, indian culture. should be more informative. More than half of museum had an exhibition of islamic architecture that I was not interested."
Cheryl H,27,Aug 2012,August 2012,50,Get an insight to Asian history,"Plan to spend a few hours wandering around. The only problem is where to start, as there are several equally interesting galleries. Displays are  set out well, and interactive panels make it easy to learn lots in a short time. However there are very few places to sit (ie to stop for viewing longer clips). Very friendly and helpful staff. Concessions for senior available, and lifts are an alternative to using the grand staircase. Suitable for families with older children."
Adytiger,74,Aug 2012,August 2012,50,Very good,Well worth a visit - close to old colonial centre and very informative on history of Singapore and its development. Recommended.
Professor572,252,Aug 2012,September 2011,50,A little gem,"The museum is located in what used to be the immigration office.  Singapore decided several years ago to stop gutting itself and ripping out its history, and has preserved some important buildings.  The collection here is small but high quality.  The temporary shows and exhibits range from great to truly extraordinary."
Immy_in_Singers,7,Aug 2012,March 2012,50,"Fantastic exhibitions, interactive digital QR codes and great wining and dining options by the river","This museum is housed in a beautiful colonial building on the Singapore river.  With 3 serene Budda's at the entrance your zen factor is already relaxing you.  Unlike many of the stuffy and dull museums, this one has fantastic exhibitions, has embraced digital QR codes to enhance the experience in way that will appeal to adults and kiddies alike.<br/><br/>Fantastic cafe Siem Reap on the doorstep for traditional Vietnamese Spring Rolls.  Later at night dine at their signature restaurant: Indochine by the river.  You won't be disappointed (although the wine is outrageously expensive...)."
yoan_destalinda,18,Aug 2012,August 2012,50,Awesome!,"Just like the name, the museum exhibits the history and cultures from all around Asia, from west to east, south to north.<br/>They divide the room into several section. The 1st floor is about the history of Singapore and South Asia (mostly India). The 2nd floor is about South East Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand),  East Asia (China), and West Asia (mostly about moslem cultures). The 3rd floor is about art performance from Asia, they put a very big screen displaying ""gamelan"" (Indonesia - Javanese traditional music) and ""Mask Dancing"" (Indonesia - Javanese traditional dance). <br/>They put a very interesting display and provide high-tech tools to help us getting more information about the content. <br/>This is a very good place to get holistic insight about Asia culture, and we will be surprised knowing that most of places in Asia was connected in the history of past time.<br/>The entrance fee is SGD 8, and it is so worthy! You will need 3 - 4 hours to get full understanding about Asian Culture."

kjvvsingapore,26,Aug 2012,August 2012,50,Surprisingly excellent and exciting,"I did not anticipate how much I would enjoy the exhibits and what I learned at this museum. Even if you don't love Asian art or think that museums like this would be dry or boring, you should go. This one is not, and it's so insightful that it should be a mandatory stop for all visitors to Singapore!"
TravelGirlKate,78,Aug 2012,August 2012,40,Interesting Museum,"The Asian Civilizations Museum definitely could keep my attention. It was interactive, interesting, hands-on, and visually stimulating. All of these factors made it easy to learn new things about SE Asia, in particular the early years of trade. It was well worth the fee and a great educational site. I would recommend this museum to older children and teenagers too—especially those studying the era of trade in Malaysia, Indonesia, or Singapore. A great resource filled with artifacts from the region's history."

dekalbill,587,Aug 2012,June 2012,40,Step into Asian Culture,Great introduction to the interesting and beautiful culture of Southeast Asia.  Easy to spend a few delightful hours immersing yourself arts and artifacts that are displayed well.  Staff was helpful.
NoelDubai,209,Aug 2012,August 2012,40,Great insight into Asian culture,"We were planning on going to Botanical Gardens but it started to rain so we decided to visit here instead and are glad we did.  It is very well laid out, big spaces around all the exhibits, and the explanations for everything are excellent.  Lighting is very good, i.e. it's dim rather than harsh lighting and nice and cool which is great in Singapore.  It is a big space to walk around and you do need a couple of hours.  If you have any interest in Singapore and Asia in general, its culture, religions, people this is an excellent place to visit.  And if like us you have lived in and visited Asia for many years there are still things to discover."
Marguerite J,135,Aug 2012,August 2012,40,Wonderfully displayed artifacts,"Really well designed museum with artifacts from Asian cultures.  I enjoyed the ""talked head"" videos throughout the museum, a screen with a video of a person from the culture explaining the heritage.  There are free tours a well.  We paid for a family package, $20 for two kids and 4 adults.  <br/><br/>There was a scavenger hunt with prize at the end for the kids, but nothing else and they were not impressed with the dark galleries.<br/><br/>If you are looking for Singaporean history, go to the National museum, this museum has very little about Singapore."
Brunhilda7,"1,724",Aug 2012,August 2012,40,Worth a short visit,"If you want to find out more things about Singapore's past and its cultural influences, visit this museum! It is a very interesting place to spend around 2 hours. <br/>My husband and I arrived around 5:30 p.m. and we only paid 6 SGD/person, as compared to the normal fare of 8 SGD/person, although we are neither Singaporeans nor permanent residents.<br/>My only complaints are about the souvenir shop inside the museum - the prices are too high - and about the lack of toilets on the ground floor - for that you have to go to the 2nd floor if I remember well!"
TaraQu,64,Aug 2012,NA,40,Great,It was educational and full of Chinese culture experience. It is a good place to learn more about the country and their people.
Jessica D,149,Aug 2012,August 2012,40,worth a visit,Was recently in Singapore for a 48-hour stay coming in from Thailand and made a stop at this museum.  It only cost $8 for a ticket and they even offer complimentary one-hour tours through the museum.  Displays are well maintained and the Islamic Arts from Southeast Asia exhibit is there until January.
iamthemanager888,5,Aug 2012,NA,20,not attractive enough,the lack of interactive displays for children to learn about history and also the exhibits seem to be the same.boring! There should be more exciting things like travel back to time display with moving figures or 4d adventure movies to entice the attention of visitors.
Mastertravellers,72,Aug 2012,June 2012,50,A surprise,"A heavy rain shower encouraged us to visit this museum and we were so pleased we did.  We spent a couple of hours here and learnt a lot about the history of Singapore and Asia in general.  One of the best Museums we have visited.  Artefacts date back to 840ad, fantastic."
DhobyMick,24,Aug 2012,July 2012,40,An Excellent Museum but .....,"We used to live in Singapore and this was always our favorite museum.  We have in the past seen some amazing exhibitions there.  On a recent trip back to Singapore from the UK, we decided to revisit.  The permanent collection on display is an absolute joy to see and my wife and I were thrilled to see it again.  There was also an interesting special display on Islamic art which we found interesting in parts (especially the Persian art).  However, one thing upset me and that was the state of the washrooms (rest rooms).  They were filthy and there were no dryers or towels to dry the hands.  I complained at the front desk but the Chinese guy there just looked blankly at me and said nothing.  Perhaps he didn't understand English.  What's happening?  Please, please Singapore don't let your standards drop.  You were always the best!!"
Mommychua,14,Aug 2012,NA,40,Well Curated Museum,"Despite its being a heritage building, the museum is well curated and offers great insight of Asian culture. <br/><br/>It's enjoyable for adults and primary school age."

Rhythm D,"3,532",Aug 2012,September 2011,40,Curious!,Something different to try in Singapore. The museum is quite different from other museums in the world. This museum is culturally so rich and everything will make you curious. Things look so different and strange! Give a visit if you have some hours to spend!
Lava_Trek,57,Aug 2012,June 2012,50,Terrific for kids,"Kids and history usually don't mesh well.  ACM has done an excellent job.  There are scavenger hunts for kids with a little prize at the end. Every major area also had a hands-on section for kids - wearing costumes, trying out a musical instrument, etc."
Debbie K,"9,787",Aug 2012,December 2011,50,Great Museum,"I thought this museum was one of the best I have ever visited. if you are interested in Asian cultures, this museum is fantastic. It gives some very interesting details about the variety of cultures found in Asia. It is worth a visit if you have some spare time in Singapore."
Raymond W,"4,412",Aug 2012,August 2012,50,One of the Region's Best Collections,"In a region where artistic wonders are often left to rot in old cabinets, this museum is a welcome change. Here the exhibits are displayed as they ought to be, with sensitive lighting and helpful descriptions of the objects. Covering all elements of Singapore's ethnic mix, as well as some wonderful pieces from as far abroad as Vietnam, Indonesia and even the Chinese Imperial Court, history buffs will love this place."
neurosis3000,35,Jul 2012,February 2012,50,Educational,"We spent an afternoon here which was barely enough to cover all the exhibits here representing the different parts of the Orient. To top it off, our guide was a lady from Kazakhstan. So very cosmopolitan!"
KIWIKEITH,544,Jul 2012,July 2012,40,If you have a spare couple of hours,There is lots to see and do here.I found the lay out and directions not that good.What they do have is very good .Best kept for a rainy day or if there are any special exerbitions on.A shame we just missed the Terracotta Warriers.
BenQ255093,11,Jul 2012,July 2012,50,Eye opener,"This museum is worth a few hours, at least.  So much good and ancient stuff to see.  And a cheap entrance fee."
RhondaZP,76,Jul 2012,February 2012,50,Visited many times,Exhibits change constantly. They had a wonderful Indian Textile exhibit earlier this year which was EXCELLENT showing the history of Indian textiles from the days of ancient Egypt. It also showed how Indian textiles were a major export from the 14th to 20th century.
Dianne B,13,Jul 2012,June 2012,50,Excellent displays and special exhibitions (,"Did not visit all galleries, but as usual, those we did, especially the Tang Shipwreck artefacts, were very well mounted, with informative captioning, and gave great insight to the themes of the displays."

StevePeters64,208,Jul 2012,May 2012,50,THE BEST MUSEUM IN ASEAN,"This is a MUST do.   I think this is the best museam in South East Asia.  With the exception of a few politically correct narratives, this museum is a great introduction to the complexity of Asian History and culture.<br/>If you are new to Singapore, do this in your first few months and spend a few hours there.  You will get a lot of background which will make life a lot easier to understand in Singapore"
Sharon T,30,Jul 2012,March 2012,50,Wonderful Exhibit and Respite on Rainy Day,We enjoyed visiting this museum on a rainy day in Singapore in March 2012.  We were home-schooling our three kids while traveling around the world and the exhibit on Pottery from a recovered ship from 2000 years ago as a very interesting platform for us to discuss the history of the area.

Foody R,139,Jul 2012,March 2012,20,The building is the most interesting,"Its a pretty boring exhibition with not a lot of highlights. Sometimes there are some specials which make it interesting though, but this is quite rare. Its a nice buidling from outside, but not worth to pay the entrance."
Dan G,10,Jul 2012,July 2012,40,Great museum,"The exhibits were very well displayed and the content is amazing.  If museums are your thing, one could easily spend an entire day there."

Lnmsdad,45,Jul 2012,July 2012,40,A find in the Marina Bay area,"We were not familiar with Asian history and its relationship to Singapore.  This museum is a well organized, well presented introduction, well worth an hour or 2."

roopinoo,76,Jul 2012,July 2012,50,An educational experience!,"This museum only cost $5 to get in and was incredibly informative.  It covers the history of almost all of Asia.  There is information about art, religion, and general history on the area."
BrianCarlsen,17,Jul 2012,August 2011,50,Snuck in line. Saw the Terracotta warriors for free.,Was a huge line to get in to see the Terracotta warriors. Think it was the first weekend they were on display. I was going to ask where I could pay and got pushed in line to see the terracotta warriors exhibit before i got a chance to pay.. Abit of history buff and just about every piece there is amazing. Explains the history of S.E asia very well.
clairebear802,40,Jul 2012,February 2012,40,Interesting,It was really interesting looking at the artefacts and learning some of Singapore's history. As a student I got in for free as well :)

MaxSpark,347,Jul 2012,June 2012,40,Interesting!,Great place to spend a rainy day. <br/>Good displays and interesting to compare the local culture and development of Singapore
Rene S,43,Jul 2012,August 2011,50,Excellent,"The open air restaurant attached to the side of the museum is fantastic. It serves fantastic Indo-Chine food, fabulous drinks and all served whilst overlooking the river with its' lanterned junks. Not to mention the band which serenades with a mix of slow jazz and blues."

goldencleo88,31,Jun 2012,July 2011,50,Learn more about Singapore,"My teenaged kids enjoyed going through the museum.  A great way to experience Singapore is by knowing its history and they have audio &amp; video facilities, a great collection but make sure you have more than 3 hours to spare.  The museum has 5 floors."
Lois G,545,Jun 2012,June 2012,50,Great history and architecture,The building itself is an amazing piece of architecture. Inside it is nice and cool and the exhibits are well presented. There are usually special exhibitions on during the year.
Missybee16,38,Jun 2012,June 2012,50,Great Museum,"Although I'm not an avid Museum visitor, I found the layout and information of the ACM excellent.  It gave me a greater understanding of the history of Singapore and all it's different cultures.  I especially enjoyed the Tang shipwreck display.  Thank you also to all the volunteer tour guides offering their time to share their knowledge with us on free tours of the ACM.  Definitely worth a visit and very much affordable at $5 SGD for an adult.."
fisherpl,154,Jun 2012,December 2011,50,Well worth a visit,A visit here gives you a better understanding of the history of singapore &amp; its varied cultures.
A R,194,Jun 2012,July 2011,40,A Look Into Singapore History,"A very interesting, well laid out museum.  We visited because it was raining and were glad we did.  It describes the history of Singapore and has all sorts of interesting Asian artefacts on show.  Some of these are incredibly beautiful."
Stu531,188,Jun 2012,June 2012,30,Interesting enough and has A/C,Interesting areas although some of the touch screens seemed to not work.  A good way to get out of the midday sun.  Worth a visit
BallardBeaver,862,Jun 2012,June 2012,50,Outstanding &amp; Good Value for Singapore,"This is a large, well organized museum with high quality exhibits from all over the place. Wellworth a visit,and surprisingly affordable at only $S5."
yunderup1,189,Jun 2012,June 2012,40,Interesting and a lovely building,We went in to the Museum mainly because of a special exhibition that was on about Indian textiles in Asia.  It was a nice place to stop on a hot and humid day and the building itself was very beautiful with high ceilings.  Very interesting displays and gave a good picture of Singapore and other asian nations.  Wellw orht a visit.
Jan E,695,Jun 2012,June 2012,50,World class museum,"The other reviewers have really said it all.  This is a really excellent museum with attractive, handson, interactive displays.  Any technology used helps and does not detract.  <br/>Attractive building and location.  Extremely nice staff.  Cool museum shop.  Even the loos are nice! <br/><br/>The one (BIG) downside is that there was nowhere to eat!  My son announced on arrival that he was hungry so we headed for the restaurant to find it is a very fancy ""Indochine"". Well it is bang next to the Business District so it must be great for a business lunch if you have an expense account.  Perhaps I was just hot and tired but I couldn't face crossing the river to Boat Quay's tourist trap or entering the maze that is Raffles Place.  My son was ordered to eat his bag of crisps and be quiet!  My advice - take a picnic lunch and eat it by the river."
Lauren S,125,Jun 2012,December 2011,50,While away a few hours...,A very well stocked and organised museum. Not great for very young children but for adults and older children it provides a fascinating insight to all aspects of Asian history.
Deb R,22,Jun 2012,May 2012,50,Well laid out and interesting,We have a great interest in Asian cultures and have travelled extensively thorughout Asia.  The displays and information were authentic and well laid out highlighting the similarities and and differences between the regions.  There were particularly good exhibitions of the Tang Shipwreck and Indian textiles.
Mathew888,61,Jun 2012,June 2012,50,One of Asia's best small museums,ACM is one of the few museums in Asia where you can get see representative objects from all major Asian and SE Asian cultures. It puts the great sweep of Asian cultures into an understandable and coherent whole. Especially good are the free guided tours by excellent  and well-trained volunteer guides. These folks are really knowledgeable and giving the tours as they want others to understand and enjoy the different Asian cultures on show. Well worthwhile.
Durhamtraveler,60,Jun 2012,June 2012,50,Great Museum,This modern museum is outstanding. It is housed in a most attractive setting and the staff members are most helpful. Very much worth the time to visit.
Deepti,194,Jun 2012,May 2012,30,"Very well presented, but that's all","The Asian Civiliations Museum has presented Asian Civilisations in a beautiful and interesting manner. But the quantity and quality of exhibits could perhaps be better. <br/><br/>What I liked is the way they depicted an Indonesian hut or a Chinese cafe. This makes visit interesting, otherwise it tends to be a bit repetitive and boring. Also, lighting could be improved perhaps?"
kunasuntari m,11,Jun 2012,NA,30,Down the Memory lane,The exhibits brought back lots of memories from the past. They are good for the younger generation to note. one can appreciate the progress of civilization by looking back at what we came from.
Explorasi-Makan,87,Jun 2012,November 2011,50,"atmospheric, interesting collection, good curation","The air conditioning is a major draw! The museum itself is a bit small, so it's manageable to see in 2-3 hours. The museum is divided into four major sections that trace the roots of Muslims, Indians, Chinese, and Southeast Asia in general. There is a really interesting Malay / Southeast Asian gold jewellery collection and some beautiful ancient carvings from the region.<br/><br/>It's a very dark museum to preserve the artifacts, which I think creates a very nice atmosphere. There are often good traveling exhibitions to look out for (that cost a bit extra) and the children's section is great - very interactive."
LDB65,308,Jun 2012,May 2012,40,Beautiful artefacts,"lovely items, well displayed though I found the lighting too dim in places. A good escape from Singapore's heat."
Zuzana M,"1,256",Jun 2012,June 2012,40,Great overview of asian cultures,"This museum provides wide and comprehensible overview of various cultures of the asian continent. Starting from the history of singapore, its various rooms lead you through the most important artefacts of each of the cultures. there are descriptions, brief history, displays of art, textile, tools, pictures for civilisations. The exhibition is equipped with TV screens, where narrators tell you more about each part.<br/>The exhibit is interactive, so even kid are involved and can learn the easy, playful way.<br/>Needless to say, it resides in a beautiful building alongside the Singapore river, with a calm atmosphere.<br/>The admission fee is SGD 8, and SGD 4 for students, seniors and children.<br/>One of the most interesting museums i've been to.<br/>2 hours weren't enough, so i'd come back."
Looksee999,209,Jun 2012,June 2012,50,Lost Civilisations,Lots to see and many fantastic and exquisite exhibitions. An oasis out of the heat where you can certainly get lost in history.
DoctrineofGabe,37,Jun 2012,September 2011,40,Should be bigger,"It seems like they took one artefact of each culture and made a museum out of it. It would be better to make a museum out of one culture instead of the whole Asian culture. <br/>Still, it is a nice try, and kids do enjoy the exhibits."
Vera P,109,May 2012,May 2012,40,Gem of a museum,Virtual guides provide extensive overviews of many sections.  Guided tour is also available.  The quality of the items exhibited was mind blowing.
Denise095,302,May 2012,May 2012,40,"Interesting, small and manageable","This is a good museum for the taste of various parts of Asia.  There is not a huge array of exhibits, and they are a bit random, but you learn a lot and you can take it in because it is not large. Beautifully presented too.  And the area around is interesting"
b_lizard76,98,May 2012,December 2011,50,Best curated museum in Singapore,"This is the best curated museum in Singapore. It's small but there's a lot to see. It's also centrally located in a scenic area near the Singapore River. I also like the Art Museum, but I think this is still better."
Terve,33,May 2012,April 2012,50,"Beautiful, interactive museum","Actually all the museum in Singapore are interactive and therefore nice to visit with children. We liked ACM because it gives you an insight in culture in a short, very organized way. They have made a very beautiful selection of what to show, so you do not have go through uncountable cupboard or displays to get that asian feeling. Kids loved it too therefore. They just got enough information and amazing things to see and not getting overwhelmed."
Ijurco A,25,May 2012,April 2012,50,Excellent,"Beautiful museum, with artifacts representing most Asian cultures. There are free museum tours, and even the guides who were there just practising their monologues were happy to share their knowledge with me."
JojoChan,94,May 2012,NA,30,Niche Museum,"This is an interesting museum as they bring in exhibits of interesting theme.  However, it is very niche eg Egyptian artifacts.  If you are not into the particular theme at that moment, there is no other reasons to visit."

laansa,79,May 2012,February 2012,40,A great museum for those interested in Asian artefacts,The museum is in a colonial building in an historical part of Singapore. The Southeast Asia gallery has a  good collection of artefacts from all over the region. There are free guided tours (11 am and 2.00pm) but I preferred just to wander around by myself; as the museum is small this is easy to do.

joycechoice,70,May 2012,August 2011,50,Great learning experience,"I have been 3 times to this museum. First time was for the Emperor Kang Xi exhibition, second was just a normal visit and third was for the China Terracotta Warrior exhibition. <br/>The museum is not huge but great for 2 hour walk around. Time if when there are tours done by volunteers. The volunteers come from different backgrounds and emphasise on different things so i never get bored going through the same exhibit. Once there was an american professor of Asian studies and she was very enlightening and made it so easy to follow and remember.<br/>The terracotta warriors was fantastic. I have been to Xian but it was not like this. Some of the exhibits we didn't get to see in Xian, and i was told they came from pit #20, which is not open to the public, but the pieces were displayed here. In Xian, only pits #1,2 and 3 were open to the public when i was there last year.<br/>Also, this exhibition was the concerted effort of 4 different museums, so we got to see the artifacts of Qin era as well as Han, the dynasty after Qin. If you went to Xian, you only see terracotta warriors, so this is better! Great value for money!"
Linda M,223,May 2012,April 2012,50,Beautiful and Educational,"The ACM is always a pleasure. The permanent exhibits are interesting every visit, and the temporary ones cover a wide range of topics. Special tours, curators' walks, lectures, and conferences enhance the experience. Worth many trips to learn and appreciate the arts and cultures of Asia."
docbruce,811,May 2012,May 2012,50,great place to begin a tour of SE Asia,Asian Civilizations museum displays information about the formative religions and cultures of SE Asia in a way that really helps one understand what happened and why.

There are beautiful photographs, models, and artifacts on display as well. I think you definitely will need a whole day for this, as I spent the afternoon there and only managed a few exhibits. I also noticed an attached cafe for those in need of sustenance."

PerakSuziah,3,May 2012,April 2012,50,Wonderful,"A great museum, you should spend about 3 to 4 hours to visit, there are many interesting things here.

Getassha,122,May 2012,June 2011,40,Great artefacts and exhibits!,Have always enjoyed visiting museums and the ACM has lived up to the expectations of that. Great care was taken to ensure the artefacts and exhibits were displayed in the best way.<br/>There were also interactive displays for children so they wouldn't get bored and they explained the different stories accordingly in a simple and fun way.
SingaporeGirl,527,May 2012,April 2012,50,Top attraction in Singapore,"Many museums focus only on the country they are located in but one of the winning elements of Singapore's ACM is that it focuses on the entire region--South Asia, West Asia, SE Asia and East Asia (China)--those areas that have contributed to Singaporean life and culture. The exhibition space is small but the exhibits themselves are fascinating  because they are built upon the original Raffles collections that featured cultural items. As a result, there are shrunken heads, spears and exhibitions that kids love in addition to pottery, statues of the Buddha and textiles. Best of all are the free tours led by docents who clearly love what they do. There are three free public tours a day, and often specialised tours (ask at the front desk) that focus on special exhibitions or themes. Do a regular tour, have lunch in one of the nearby riverside restaurants that serve everything from local fare to fish &amp; chips, then return for a specialised tour. Great value and a wonderful introduction to the area."

The displays not eh second floor were very good covering different types of weavings and cloths from different Asian countries. i would recommend this even if I had to pay the normal admission charge."
penelopeessence,24,Apr 2012,April 2012,40,A cool and peaceful atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle the,"The atmosphere of the museum is quiet and peaceful. I had a wonderful free tour of the museum led by a new docent. There is now a beautiful temporary exhibition of Indian textiles but it needed more curating, information and a good catalogue to be available. The museum shop could be larger and the restaurant/cafe could be open longer and have opening hours displayed more prominently."
Thailand_fan_Eric,104,Apr 2012,April 2012,50,Nice Museum,"Go here if you have some time left! Beautiful things inside, check it out!"
tanagogo1,998,Apr 2012,NA,40,A good day out,"Came here on my own, as I had a business trip and a free weekend. Very well appointed museum, not so big you get bored. Very informative, learnt alot about Singapore."
Cynthia O,208,Apr 2012,March 2012,50,"Stunning exhibits, worth the price of admission","If you have an hour or so late afternoon, do pop in to see the exhibits.  Lovely and a nice break from the afternoon heat."
Tucson10,16,Apr 2012,April 2012,50,Asian Civilizations Museum,"Lovely building, and very good displays related to the many cultures in the area. Special show was on patterns of trade, and used lovely ancient fabrics for the display.  We had 2 docent led tours, one of the Chinese area, and the other of the fabrics; both were excellent."
Sheila196,4,Apr 2012,April 2012,40,Interesting and informative,"A visit to this museum gives an illuminating insight into the rich and multicultural history of Singapore. More specifically, it traces the arrival to the island of  individual cultures such as the Malays, Indians and Chinese. Currently there is a magnificent exhibition of items from the 9th century ""Tang ""shipwreck. This ship was carrying a cargo of Chinese ceramics, gold and silver to the middle east. For me, this was a highlight of my holiday, definitely put it on your itinerary."
Katherine J,13,Apr 2012,December 2011,40,Lovely,"Beautiful building, beautiful exhibits, very informative.  Great gift shop and nice restaurant.  One can easily spend the day and leave happy!"
Ativ A,39,Apr 2012,April 2012,40,Explorations zones are nice :-),It is good to visit this museum for people who are just slightly familiar with Asian culture. You will find many interesting things there. Since I'm living in Asia and aware of different cultures and visited different Asian museums...explorations zones were interesting places for me. Consider to spend there minumum 2 hours.
1sma2,29,Apr 2012,March 2012,50,wonderful,"We like the interesting exhibits about different ethnic groups and ended up staying the entire day, til we dropped.  However, most of the exhibits were very dark, including ones which had material that is not affected by light.  While I understand the need to protect sensitive material from flash photos, prohibiting all photos and keeping the entire museum dark is unreasonable and unnecessary."
MelbourneTravelmad,772,Apr 2012,July 2011,40,Gain an understanding of Asian history,"A very interesting museum.Very good artifacts and displays and some very interesting information provided on Asian history. Well worth the visit while you're in Singapore,"
gingko2,332,Apr 2012,April 2012,50,Amazing Museum,"This is a brilliant museum we have visited a few times over the years.  On this occasion there was a very interesting exhibition called Patterns of Trade.   The exhibits are all well displayed.  The lighting is so low I found it rather draining in there.  There are a few video talks, but as there is a seat in front of them they are not readily shared.   This is worth visiting just to observe the painstaking labour involved in making these lengths of material.<br/>There are many other galleries covering a myriad of subjects.   We also visited the exhibit of ceramics recovered from the Tang shipwreck in 9th century. This is a spectacular display of treasures recovered after 1,100 years submerged in the ocean off Belitung Island, Indonesia.   Allow plenty of time for this museum - there is SO much of interest there."
Martin G,381,Apr 2012,February 2012,40,Interesting for anyone interested in Asian history. Not too crowded so it was enjoyable.,Exhibits were good and well presented.  The halls were spacious and in keeping with the exhibits.

AndrewYew,"4,185",Apr 2012,May 2011,30,Nice Place,It is a nice museum with fairly interesting exhibits. Good if you are interested in South East Asian culture. Nice colonial building. Can have a nice walk at the riverside before or after. The Merlion is also a nice short walk away.
MirelaD,35,Apr 2012,January 2012,50,Cultural diversity,"We had only few hours in the afternoon to visit it. Very nice place, bringing together Singapore, India, Indonesia, China, Thailand, Middle East, so diverse. You have to go for two days, or at least one full day. The groundfloor is mainly Indian culture, too bad we had just one hour left to visit it"

Luvshiraz,162,Apr 2012,April 2012,50,ACM - Asian Civilisations Museum,"A FABULOUS EXPERIENCE - this is time well invested if you visit one of Singapore's Best and Successful Icons - the ACM presentations are excellently done - Catch a ""docent-led"" tour of the exhibits - an hour well spent - please visit!"
Singaporeconncection,68,Apr 2012,March 2012,50,Best in SE Asia,ACM is probably the best museum in SE Asia. It has an extensive exhibit of artifacts from the region and regularly sponsors in depth exhibits about Asia from other museums of the world. The colonial building and boat quay location are worth a visit alone.
Pat399,14,Apr 2012,March 2012,50,Coles notes on Asian culture,I feel I got a quick introduction to a variety of Asian cultures in one spot. Great way to start a visit to the area and gain some understanding. I really enjoyed all exhibits except theone on Patterns of trade which proved to be on textiles rather than trade routes of South East Asia..my mistake.
Cikusa,101,Apr 2012,March 2012,40,Love free Monday morning lectures!,"My friend who has a membership card for museums took me to Asian Civilisations Museum for a nice tour. It was worthy to me to see all the historic tools, documents and to learn more about Asian civilisations.<br/>There is a lovely coffee bar inside if one wants to relax and enjoy after hours of learning :)<br/>What I love is that every Monday there are free lectures, from 11am-noon. Some topics are interesting to me, like culinary, fabrics, or even architecture- always something to learn!<br/><br/>Sure worthy your visit."
Sine T,180,Apr 2012,March 2012,40,Very interesting,"We had a personal tour of the Asian Civilizations Museum by a friend who occasionally works as a tour guide there, so we are probably biased. We really enjoyed the museum and the many artifacts and hearing all the background information. I liked that the museum was very well spaced and not too big, so that we got to see almost all the exhibits in less than 2 hours."
Dekari,95,Apr 2012,March 2012,50,Excellent for Families,Due to a rainy morning we made an unscheduled stop at the Asian Civilisations Museum and we learned a lot about Asian culture and history. The museum is well laid out and easy to navigate. The displays are excellent and comprehensive explanations are provided for each one. There are plenty of interactive exhibits to keep children entertained too. Well worth a visit.
MorskaVydra,164,Mar 2012,March 2012,50,Excellent Museum,"One learns a lot on Asian history, culture, trade routs, people, there is lot of both written and spoken interactive information in English. Beautiful artifacts, I presume many of them priceless. Architecture, ceramics, fabrics, jewelry, sculptures... I believe everybody can find something of interest."
Junie O,14,Mar 2012,March 2012,30,More publicity would be wonderful!,"Beautiful architecture and heritage, the building is a  refreshing backdrop against the Singapore River.<br/>Attended a AustCham Networking Event there. Great venue, excellent views of the skyscrapers and the river.<br/><br/>Although I wonder if there is carpark facility nearby?<br/>The nearest and most convenient parking place, I reckon, would be fullerton hotel and standchart building from across the Cavenagh bridge, which is a short scenic stroll away."
Charlie7fR,65,Mar 2012,March 2012,40,Nice Museum,This museum is in one of the best locations. You can get there walking. The museum is really organized and high quality.
PurpleLily11,185,Mar 2012,NA,50,One of my favorite museums,"My eyes could not get enough of this place. A couple of hours didn't feel like enough as there was just too much to see. I went towards the end of the day and it wasn't crowded at all, which was really nice but I don't know if this was typical or just due to timing."
flossyPembrokeshire,184,Mar 2012,March 2012,50,fascinating,its a wonderful museum but you need plenty of time as there is so much to see we made the mistake of popping in as we had about 90mins to spare-you need a few hours ideally
annacorey,81,Mar 2012,May 2011,50,History on the River,Loved the location and everything you can learn about the history and culture here.  The location makes it perfect for strolling the river and having a wonderful meal after the visit.
chongbrood,176,Mar 2012,December 2011,50,Fascinating cultural insights,"With the National History Museum, the Peranakan Museum, this ranks as one of Singapore's best museums. If you have the time, try attending one of the many talks by experts that the museum organises."
corinaZ,426,Mar 2012,March 2012,50,not to be missed,"Having a few hours to spend until the return flight, I entered here and it was the smartest choice I cold do. The museum is very divers and covers all the civilizations from the SE Asia in a complete and enjoying way. I liked especially the part referring to China and to India. I also had the chance to see a temporary exhibition about printed textiles coming from India...it was exceptional..So don`t avoid the place. The fee is small(8 S$ for an adult) and...you`ll also have the chance to get all this precious informations away from the outside heat ..."
Chriscjw,8,Mar 2012,February 2012,40,A interesting experience,"The museum opened early was was a plus in a country where most things don't open until after ten. Interesting displays, well presented"
dbryabi,66,Mar 2012,March 2012,50,One of the best museums I have ever seen,"This museum has some fantastic displays. At the moment there is a display of a Tang Shipwreck, with some amazing artifacts. Also there are a lot of Singaporean culture displays. One I really enjoyed was the displays of Batik and how it is made. I think this museum is not one to be missed"
RedSkyWalker22,248,Mar 2012,April 2011,50,Not to lose under any circumstances,"A very attractive modern museum, which travels you to all local civilisations through images and sounds. You can spend half a day in there and feel you would like to stay longer."
fedrickMendos,22,Mar 2012,March 2012,50,Worth the Time and Charges,I would say - don't miss out. Worth the time spent and the money. I wanted to stay 1 hour but end up staying for about 3 hours.
debcox,754,Mar 2012,November 2011,50,facinating collection.,The museum is located very centrally and has the most incredible collection of artefacts covering centuries of the asian cultural history which will not dissapoint those who wish to know more about this most facinating part of the world.
Danjiro,230,Mar 2012,December 2011,50,World Class,"The Asian Civilisations Museum is a great way to see the history of Singapore, as well as the cultures and ethnic groups that form the core of the population. The exhibits are very well done and engaging. The traveling exhibits are also great and something to look forward to."
wendy9115,86,Mar 2012,November 2011,40,"Rich in culture ,worth it","Worth a trip there, went there for free if you are a student in singapore. ( Not sure if it still available for now) <br/>Excellent presentation and it was a sensational trip there, recommend for a visit"
drewsmithbco,6,Mar 2012,NA,50,Top notch content and presentation,"Stunning displays of SE Asian material cultures, with excellent explanations of historical and economic context."
ericAKIRA,231,Mar 2012,September 2011,40,Practical Museum close to Merlion Park,"Overall, this museum is really worth a try. Its Collection is quite interesting, nice atmosphere, lots of interactive computer facilities. You can find more information about a topic at their public touch screen computers. Unfortunately, they don't allow any photo taken with flash. So handy cameras will get many blurred images inside this museum.<br/><br/>This museum's Admission fee is not too expensive. Also available for family package (which is cheaper). Its location also makes it worth a visit, because only about 300 from the Famous Merlion Park and Esplanade. We just need to cross the street from One Fullerton near the Merlion Park, and walk towards the bridge next to the Fullerton Hotel to get there."
aussiemama,261,Mar 2012,October 2011,50,Terracotta Warriors rock,"We were so fortunate to be in Singapore while this incredible exhibition was on. Despite it being a small exhibit, the tour guides and information on offer made up for it."

KR_EDINBURGH,"2,329",Mar 2012,February 2012,40,One of the best in Singapore,Top class museum with fascinating artefacts. Would visit again as one visit is really not enough to appreciate everything.
budge185,218,Mar 2012,March 2012,50,Excellent museum,"If you are a fan of museums and history, definitely visit the Asian Civilisations Museum. Even if you aren't, this is a worthwhile excursion for a rainy day. Located at Empress Place, it is very close to Fullerton hotel. <br/><br/>The exhibitions are very well set out canvassing each of the main South East Asian cultures that have influenced what Singapore is today. I spent a very worthwhile couple of hours here."
MrCushtie,413,Mar 2012,NA,40,"Good, although could do with better signage","This museum is housed in a lovely building, although there's not much natural light, so a lot of the rooms are a little gloomy; compared, say, with the airiness of the V&amp;A in London, it comes up a little short.<br/><br/>There's a lot of stuff here: sometimes I felt that there could be more detail to give context on the contents of the cabinets. For example, the various swords and krises all look very nice, but were they ceremonial, or actually used for combat? Likewise the jewellery is all very beautiful, but I was left unclear on who would get to wear it and who wouldn't.<br/><br/>Interestingly, probably the best part of the museum for delineating differing opinions of history is the modern Singaporean portion, which points out that although some Singaporeans were very pleased with the project to clean the river, those whose livelihoods depended directly on it had some complaints to make.<br/><br/>Particularly worthwhile are the different Buddhas and the textile exhibits. The recovered Chinese pottery from the Belitung shipwreck is also very good."
Alex_Tallinn,369,Mar 2012,February 2012,30,Not Really a Museum but a Propaganda Kiosk,"This facility is housed in a beautiful 19th century structure, a former Government House.  It curiously matches a similarly historic Fullerton Hotel, a former post office just across the river.  While some of its galleries were interesting, e.g. Indian textiles and Islamic calligraphy, I had two major beefs.  First, its presentation of Asian history is totally glossy and sanitized.  No blood, no war, no pain, no conflict – just nice, nice, nice, across the board.  I can well see how this slant serves the needs of a powerful government in a multi-ethnic country, but the feeling of unreality pervades.  Second, there is no clear attribution which objects on display are real and which are replicas.  I pressed our guide who admitted that some were replicas but she was not sure which were and which weren’t.  I went to the museum to see history and reality, but instead got a carefully crafted historic Disneyland."
vaitnicnent,79,Mar 2012,February 2012,50,History in Your Hands,"The thing I love about museums in Singapore is how they provide knowledge for the visitors and how interactive the information to be given. Here in Asian Civilizations Museum, they take you back through times throughout Asia; Middle East, India, Indo-China, China, Japan, Korea, Malay, etc. Cultural impacts made by the beliefs, religions, and the people are shown here through the art, rituals, utensils, food, architecture, fashion, etc. I love how this museum elaborates the diversities of Asia into a great interesting attraction. <br/><br/>Photography is allowed, but flash usage is prohibited.<br/><br/>If you bring your little kids/nephews/nieces along, no worries! They do have kid's trails in each part that let your young ones interact, learn, observe, and have fun all the way! *But, yes, please, guide them; tell them not to touch any of the display--unless it is interactive*"
cromerty,88,Mar 2012,December 2011,30,A missed opportunity,"This museum is chock full of artefacts from countries as diverse as India and Vietnam but the display defies any logic.  Is it by country, region, religion or period?  It's very difficult to work out the organizational layout and as such it becomes simply a headache inducing mish mash of artefacts and items."
Flint77,302,Mar 2012,February 2012,50,stunning museum and exhibitions,great layout in the museum and at the time we went a brilliant exhibition of Indian weaving
VBovin,38,Feb 2012,January 2012,30,Too much to see,"As many of the other reviewers point out, there is just way too much to see in this Museum.  It kind of made me feel overwhelmed.  I carved out an afternoon to slowly walk the exhibits.  But with so many rooms, and so much to read, I felt rushed the entire time.  You could easily spend days in here, and not get the full experience.  Sadly, it left me feeling disappointed that I may have missed something.  I wish I would have done the National Museum of Singapore instead."
Ross S,16,Feb 2012,February 2012,50,Must see attraction in Singapore,"The best value offered by a Museum I have been to. Even if you are just in town for a weekend and cruise through in an hour as we did, the quality and range of the exhibits makes a trip worthwhile. Especially good value for students ($4 Singaporean)"

IntrepidAussie09,109,Feb 2012,February 2012,50,"Fascinating overall picture of Asian culture, religion and trade","I wish we had allowed more time for this museum. It showed how critical the comparatively sheltered waters of Singapore were for trade routes and how that contributed to the spread of culture and religions of Asia. Some wonderful artefacts, well presented and supported by AV displays. A recently discovered ancient shipwreck provides a room full of treasures.   We took a volunteer guided tour and it was fascinating."

Myra23,3,Feb 2012,January 2012,40,A lot to learn about asian civilization.,"The museum tries it's best to share information by providing it's patrons a beautiful place to experience the history with it's collection and ambiance.  It may not have a huge building and collection as other world-class museums but I think, it succeeds in whetting the appetite of the museum goers to learn more about the asian civilization."

Zaideeanne,32,Jan 2012,January 2012,50,Excellent Museum Covering Many Asian Cultures,"I spent an afternoon at the Asian Civilisations Museum and covered all of the galleries quite extensively. I didn't have any time constraints so I was able to take the time to read the detailed information provided with many of the displays. The museum's exhibits focus on the history of the cultures of Southeast Asia, although there are also galleries covering China and the Islamic cultures of Persia and central Asia. The archaeological and historical materials in the displays were interesting and often beautiful. The only problem I had in the museum was that in some galleries the lighting was too dim, which made it difficult to read some of the extensive text describing the various objects. Brighter lighting would have been helpful. However, overall, this was a wonderful museum, and i learned a lot there. It's definitely worth a visit if you are in Singapore and have an interest in Asian history, archaeology, and anthropology."

longhaulfromlondon,356,Jan 2012,October 2011,50,Well worth a visit,A trip around this museum is well worth it. My most recent was not the only visit I've made and on each occasion I've seen a variety of things which have been interesting and I've learned a great deal about life in south east Asia and how we arrived at the current state of affairs. Well worth a visit and it provides sometimes welcome respite from the heat and shopping of Singapore.
misoTokyo,60,Jan 2012,December 2011,40,Nice,We went on X'mas day and the admission fee was free.  Very organized and nice.
finnoir,94,Jan 2012,NA,40,Love this too!,Along the Singapore River.... Has lovely bistro nearby for drinks... good way to spend a hot afternoon away from the heat.
editionsofyou,242,Jan 2012,December 2011,40,Not for the superficial culture vulture,"This museum has such a depth and range of artifacts that you need to be seriuosly interested in the history and culture of the period and area to enjoy the experience.  If you are, then the layout, display quality and depth of description of what is on show is top notch.  Not the place for young children but certainly a place for adults with a child's curiosity. Free entry on public holdays when we were there."
SanDiegoRosenthals,35,Jan 2012,December 2011,50,Excellent exhibits from all over Asia,"This is a gem of a museum.  There are many good Asian museums, and this is one of the best.  Singapore is a melting pot of many Asian cultures, and all are well represented here.  The grounds and location are just beautiful.  It rains a lot in Singapore, and this is a good place to go when the downpour begins, which is what we did."
maclorr,8,Jan 2012,September 2011,40,A little culture goes a long way,"we enjoyed seeing the early history of Singapore ,it is a truly fascinating place to visit"
eliseljh,181,Jan 2012,October 2011,50,Always revisiting,"ACM is my favorite museum among all museums in Singapore. ACM puts up very good exhibitions times after times. They are good at displaying artefacts differently, and they engage new media to allow visitors to interact with the exhibits. <br/><br/>The most recent exhibition that I visited was the one on Terracotta Warriors was very good... they had iPhone apps that we watch and listen as we navigate the exhibition hall, and QR codes to play with. Children will have a fun time too...  <br/><br/>Try to avoid the open house when there is free admission because the turnout will be massive.<br/><br/>Check out their website before you go because there may be window period when there is no special exhibition. The museum is not very big, 1-2hrs is more than sufficient."
Valesreport,37,Jan 2012,December 2011,40,Intriguing,"Interesting museum which can take a fair while to really appreciate.  The 360 degree display of Singapore was a little baffling and not really what we had expected, but a good chance to sit and rest our feet for a while."
Comfort_Traveller29,35,Jan 2012,December 2011,50,Wonderful Museum,"This museum was fantastic! Tons of information provided, and I loved all the video and interactive displays! There is so much variety throughout the museum, and it was seamless how easy it was to move through. We went on New Year's Eve because they provided free admission, a DJ outside on the lawn, and shows throughout the evening. We spent a good three hours but could have spent more going through all the displays. We had to skim the higest floor because we were getting hungry, but we loved the current textile display, and all the information on Singaporean history. The gift shop was unfortunately closed by the time we went. <br/><br/>It was a short walk (5 minute) over to Clarke Quay for a meal afterwards."
FCtravler,137,Jan 2012,December 2011,50,make sure you take the tour,"We had the best guide who walked us through the museum she was knowledgable, friendly and very very funny.  Great museum with rich history. Much to see. Buy the family plan tickets it's very inexpensive that way."
John190728,29,Jan 2012,October 2011,50,Interesting,"There was plenty to see relating to ancient Asian cultures - I didn't think I would enjoy the visit, but I did."
BerniceManila,20,Jan 2012,December 2011,50,Lovely and educational,Loved that they had a wide collection of artifacts and interactive materials!
KjartanToronto,24,Jan 2012,January 2012,50,Beautifully laid out museum with well integrated children's exploration features,Really enjoyed the new exhibit on Indian textiles. The South Indian section is small but with some wonderfully chosen statues.<br/><br/>Very accessible on history of Singapore and its historic role
Carol Blue Mountains,274,Dec 2011,December 2011,50,Not at all boring,"Very cultural, not political or historical, covering many Asian nations.  Excellent riverside restaurant attached to the museum where we had a delicious dinner afterwards.  Good gift shop"
Manuel,186,Dec 2011,December 2011,40,Great,"We had a great time, lots of learning, it is big, we took 3 hours and had to leave due to closing time."
Teirrah,88,Dec 2011,December 2011,40,Very interesting for both adults &amp; children,"I stopped by when I had 2 hours to spare after meetings at the office and a flight.  The museum is well laid out, explanations (very good english) were clear and there were fun areas for children. I would go back."
commscholar,133,Dec 2011,December 2011,50,Nice collection,"Good museum. Covers a variety of Asian civilizations.  Really enjoyed it.  They offer free tours.  Our tour guide spent way too much time on each thing, After a half hour we were still in the entry-way and most people deserted our guide. I don't know if the tours tend to be that way, or it was just this guide.  Definitely see the museum, skip the tour.  Really great gift shop. Nice stuff."
skink,368,Dec 2011,December 2011,50,Singapore's best museum by far,"The Asian Civilizations Museum is Singapore's best museum by far.  The displays are beautiful and informative and the temporary exhibits, that rotate every few months, are fascinating.  Recent temporary exhibits have included the terra cotta warriors and ""Patterns of Trade,"" an exhibit of Asian textiles that became popular on the world market."
DaliCT,102,Dec 2011,NA,40,One of my favourite in Singapore,"The ACM has a good collection of Southeast Asia artefacts. If you like S.E Asian culture, you will find this museum interesting."
Friedrich880,2,Dec 2011,December 2011,50,Great!,almost too much information on ALL you can possibly want to know about all of asia.
Ric H,8,Dec 2011,November 2011,50,Fantastic,"The Asian Civilisations Museum was my first museum in Singapore, having been highly recommended by the hostel. I was pleasantly surprised by the £4 admission charge, particularly when I realised the scale of the place. There are eight different galleries within the building. It took me an hour to finish the first one. It was a fascinating look back at the origins and cultures across Asia, as well as the manner in which many of them emigrated to Singapore and their role in its development."
Gary B,184,Dec 2011,November 2011,40,Nice to visit but it isn't the Smithsonian,This museum is a nice opportunity to see a bit of Asian culture. It has an interesting set of displays and is worth the visit but if you are used to the major museums like the Smithsonian you may be disappionted.
Pascal H,25,Dec 2011,December 2011,50,Interesting and well presented on Asian Culture,Nice displays on Asian history. Check out when they have a FREE guide available which makes you understand even more about this interesting history.
middpanther,409,Dec 2011,September 2011,40,Visited while the clay soldiers exhibit was in town,What a cool exhibit!  Their permanent collection isn't bad either.
mattyandco,183,Dec 2011,December 2011,40,a great place to dip into a bit of quiet culture,A moderatly priced museum ( ticket allows multiple re-entry over the day) dedicated to asian culture. Interesting galleries on all the major religions of the area and some stunning artefacts.
Mimi-AMD,107,Dec 2011,August 2011,50,Simple but colourful!,"I went during the summer of 2010.<br/><br/>This museum is much smaller than the others but it's cozy. this is clearly an older building with recent re-construction but it's adorable. I find it colourful and old-fashioned. You can truly admire its traditional style and history. The small galleries and presentations are still educational. Honestly, you do not need a lot of time exploring this gallery but I thought i was worth my time. if you look small galleries and museums where it's more specfic, you'll love this one. Because of its size. the information is very unique and specific."
Karl G,17,Dec 2011,December 2011,40,Best museum in Singapore,This museum has really a lot to offer and it is well made and well displayed with lots of interesting information. I spent 3 hours there.
Scott S,136,Dec 2011,December 2011,30,Average Museum,"The free guided tour was very informative and the tour guide really knew his stuff.  The actual exhibits are ok; nothing terribly special.  There is some interesting things, but it wasn't really as big of a museum as I expected.  If you have to waste a day inside because its raining or to get out of the heat, it's ok, but I wouldn't make this a must see attraction.  But maybe that's just me.  At least the 8$ entry fee for adults isn't that outrageous."
ramli27,133,Dec 2011,January 2011,50,awesome,"superbly presented exhibits, special features keep changing, most people will find a lecture topic to interest them from the myriad on offer every week"
jocelynlee,468,Dec 2011,January 2011,40,Interesting museum in a great location,A good snapshot of Asian culture and history right on the river
tabimin,26,Dec 2011,February 2011,50,quality,i was really impressed by the museum<br/>it was quite big but every part was captivating and i was happy to spend a good part of the day savouring as much as i could possibly take in<br/>especially as it was very informative (though not in an overwhelming way) and very tastefully displayed<br/>i happened to catch the congo river exhibition<br/>and i couldn't help admire the quality of the presentation and the excellent perspective it offered<br/>i wouldn't have missed it for the world and thinking back on my trip to singapore as i was leaving<br/>all i could think of was<br/>i must find a way to go back just so i can visit the asian civilizations museum again<br/>don't miss it
wokabaut,290,Dec 2011,July 2011,50,Great value and education,"This was a highlight to learn about Singapore history as well as cultural history from Asian states. The time we went the Terracotta warriors were on exhibit. That was quite an opportunity to see some of these historical pieces. The other exhibits representing Malaysia, Indonesia and other areas are also very interesting. I could easily have spent half a day at this museum. The staff are very friendly."
giribpai,293,Nov 2011,October 2011,50,For A Walk Through Lesson in History,"This new addition to the tourist attractions is among the best and should be seen by all tourists with an interest in history.  Located in a magnificent building the museum combines design, layout, lighting and exhibit detail in a manner that most other museums are not capable of.  Being a confluence of different cultures, Singapore provides the right location for a museum showcasing principal civilisations of Asia including those from China, India, Malaya and other parts of South Asia and South East Asia and even West Asia.  The history of the island country too is well depicted and makes the visit to the museum complete.  The exhibits are across 11 galleries and the museum continually hosts shows.  For a history buff, this definitely one of the best museums anywhere in the world and worth a long visit - as taking in all the information at the museum can take close to a whole day."
Bananas2985,48,Nov 2011,September 2011,50,Nice layout!,"There is a discount on Friday nights, so we went then. The Terracotta Warriors were on display when we visited, which drew in a lot of people. The museum was otherwise not very busy. They had a lot of interactive displays that would be fun for children (and adults too!) I particularly enjoyed the Singapore history section, quite informative and well laid out. The museum is right by the river; it would make for a good start to a nice night out."
syllwii,190,Nov 2011,November 2011,40,Very interesting and entertaining muzeum.,Go there at the evening as during day there are houndreds of kids running around. At the evening you can get a peacful walk with the free guide tour. Guide tour I participated started at 7pm. We were with 5 and the guide so it was a great experience as she could give us many interesting information. On Friday evenings (after 7pm) museum is for free.
colintkoh,108,Nov 2011,November 2011,50,All of Asian in one stop,Start your Asian travels here. Excellent way to get a quick insight to all the cultures of Asia. Very well displayed exhibits for the most part.
FrenchGlobetrotter,23,Nov 2011,November 2011,50,Must not be missed,"Small museum filled with treasures, not to be missed!"
Ray H,152,Nov 2011,November 2011,50,Very interesting museum,"If you're interested in the history of Asian countries,  you don't want to miss this.   Very informative museum and also interesting.  You can tour most of it in about 1.5-2 hours.   Great location by river at Raffles landing site."
jpwilli,17,Nov 2011,December 2010,40,Great place to learn about Singapore,A little off the main track this museum is worth the visit as you can learn a lot more about the straits and the people who settled here. The exhibits were mainly static but it was fine for adults. Don't recommend it for kids.
Trup,"1,126",Nov 2011,October 2011,50,One of the best museums in Asia,"Perhaps not as outstanding as the Shanghai Museum but in fairness they are really quite different kinds of museums. The Asian Civilisations Museum provides a very educational experience especially for anyone trying to understand the history of Singapore and, as well, for those about to visit nearby countries."
KookaburraSydney,65,Nov 2011,October 2011,40,Diverse and interesting,"The museum is located in a beautiful colonial building on the river. It has a diverse collection from all over Asia which is beautifully presented.  If you do not know a lot about Asian history it can be a lot to take it. However, it is a great place to go learn more about the region and also about the history of Singapore."
kivancgorkem,175,Nov 2011,November 2011,40,visit indochine restaurant,indochine located at the asian museum has very good atmosphere for dining.
SIMMO62_07,10,Nov 2011,November 2011,50,"A must see attraction, be prepared to spend several hours.","One of the best museums we have seen. Well lit, amazing collection divided into separate cultural areas specific to Asia.  Get a map and take your time. Visit the museum gift shop."
Ros,136,Nov 2011,October 2011,50,"Well curated, a very worthwhile way to spend a few hours","On a whim, my husband and I spent a few hours visiting the Asia Civilisations Museum as it was featuring an exhibit on China's terracotta warriors. While the exhibit itself was very well presented (and even featured an interactive app for the iPhone), it was the rest of the museum that kept us interested for hours.<br/><br/>Featuring religious and cultural artefacts from across Asia, the museum has the most comprehensive collection and balanced commentary I've seen. Even weighting is given to the Buddhist, Islamic, Hindu and Christian influences across the region, a reflection of Singapore's diversity and perhaps ambition (there really is a lot to take in at this museum)!<br/><br/>Overall, I can highly recommend visiting the museum, especially if you're new to the Asian region. In a matter of hours, you will feel like an expert in everything from Arabic calligraphy, to Thai weaving and Indian sculpture. <br/><br/>Tip: Take note of the username and password for the museum's free wifi. You can use these credentials to log into Singapore's city-wide wifi network, which is great if you didn't pick up a SIM card at Changi Airport."
LJJSingapore,2,Nov 2011,October 2011,40,Rich history and free guided tours,The ACM was amazing once i stepped foot in it. The counter staff informed me that there was a free guided tour on the terracotta warriors and told us the meeting point. The tour guide was very experienced and she guided us one station by one station. It was a fabulous mix of history and different themes. Mostly Asian culture.
Karine G,9,Oct 2011,October 2011,30,Asian civilisation museum,The history of Singapore was good and very interesting. So was the temporary exhibition about the terracotta army. Worth a look on a hot sunny afternoon!
Trudi M,6,Oct 2011,September 2011,50,Terracotta Warriors,Loved this Museum and the Terracotta Warriors exhibition.  Excellent range of exhibits with plenty of information about each display.

diploconcierge,453,Oct 2011,November 2010,50,Phenomenal museum,"First-rate, world-class museum.  The space is beautiful and the collections are well-organized and interactive.  Easily, one of the best museums I have visited in the world."
Numptyheid,95,Oct 2011,July 2011,50,brilliant museum,"Brilliant museum, really very interesting and not too expensive."
WoodyWestAustralia,37,Oct 2011,October 2011,50,A great collection,This is a surprisingly small museum but well worth the effort to see it's wonderfully well laid out collections. I was fortunate to visit during the small Terracotta Warrior exhbition and they even had free entry to the entire museum on the Sunday. Wow!
familytraveller646,15,Oct 2011,October 2011,50,Terracotta Warriers were there!,"There was a special exhibition of Terracotta warriors there so it was really good. However, even at other times it is in a lovely riverside location with a cross-section of Asian history and culture.  My young children were entranced for a few hours and really found the museum experience fun."
lncclc,421,Oct 2011,October 2011,50,"The museum to see, if you only have time for one.","There are traveling exhibits that change, but it gives you a great historical review of Singapore.  The exhibits are from all aspects of S.E. Asia.  We happened on a free day, otherwise about $15 US.  Half day is enough."
Cecily B,113,Oct 2011,October 2011,50,Good for multiple visits,"I visited this on my first trip to Singapore, and found the exhibit on the river to be invaluable in understanding the development of the city (and also understanding it currently). The temporary exhibits (currently the Terra Cotta Warriors) are always good, too, so I find that I visit each time I'm in town. It's location near the mouth of the river on the river walk is ideal. Definitely a keeper!"
SingersTomTom,41,Oct 2011,November 2010,50,Duck Curry at the ACM,"The Asian Civilisations Museum is one of the treasures of Singapore. In recent years there has been something of a museum renaissance and the old colonial administration building (which for a while was christened Empress Place) has become the A.C.M.<br/><br/>To me, museums are about one-to-one experiences with collection objects. I don't reject the IT driven displays that seem so often to dominate exhibits nowadays, but I do enjoy my contemplative spaces where such a communion can take place.<br/><br/>Read my full review at:<br/>http://singaporesojourn.blogspot.com/2006/12/duck-curry-at-acm.html"
Carlos-Mari,146,Oct 2011,NA,50,Must see for Asian art and culture,"If you have two or three spare hours, a visit to this magnificent museum is a must. The major cultures that contributed to the identity of Singapore have all a space to present their art, traditions and heritage in a wonderfully organised venue.<br/><br/>Familes with children are welcome, and there are quite a few interactive displays designed for younger visitors. Entry fees are also very family-friendly.<br/><br/>It's located right in the centre of town, and easily accesible by MRT at Raffles Place - you can even combine a visit to the museum with a walk along the Singapore River waterfront.<br/><br/>A perfect Sunday morning activity for all the family."
nek88,482,Oct 2011,September 2011,40,Finally see some of the Terracotta Warriors,"A delightful building, informative free guides (check the times for them) and friendly staff made this exhibition complete.  The warriors, even though only small number of them, and their horses, wagons, swords, armour and bells, were all very fascinating."
adelaidiantraveller,"12,108",Oct 2011,September 2011,40,Compelling and well organised exhibition space,"This museum is well worth a visit for anyone interested in history.<br/><br/>Presently, they are conducting the prestigious disply of the terracotta warriors (on loan from China).<br/><br/>They have a combination of permanent and short term exhibitions.<br/><br/>The displays are intelligently and professionally presented, and they give the visitor the opportunity to learn something of the history of Singapore and the region.<br/><br/>It's a compact museum, so it's relatively easy to get around if you have a limited time- allow 1-2 hours.<br/><br/>The admission price is modest, and good value for money.<br/><br/>Highly recommended- if you like this kind of museum."
SaradeUK,14,Oct 2011,NA,50,Terracotta warriors iPhone app a must!,We visited the terracotta warriors exhibition in September 2011 and cannot recommend it enough. Excellent value for money when compared to the museums back in the UK. Incredibly engaging and if you have an iPhone make sure you download the free app which accompanies the exhibition.
TokaraSC,56,Sep 2011,January 2011,50,Worthwhile visit,"I visited the museum with my 13 and 15 year old. We were all kept busy for several hours with the variety of information and displays to engage with. Our visit was late in the day, and the museum was very quiet. I wouldn't hesitate to suggest this as a worthwhile visit for kids and adults alike."
juantwomany,27,Sep 2011,September 2011,50,Great way to give context to your Asian experience,"I knew very little of Asian history and this museum was a great way of bringing it all into  context. There are great explanations of the intersections of many cultures and religions: Chinese, Malay, Hindu, Javanese and even Islamic."
Waqqas H,202,Aug 2011,August 2011,30,Great value but not a huge museum,"For $5, you can't ask for much. The museum is not massive but you can tell that professionals were incharge of the displays and laying things out (it's done very well). The only issue we had was that the exhibits are in ""rooms"" and you have to keep backtracking in and out of rooms. Perhaps the museum can borrow a page from Ikea's book about how to keep people moving onwards without having to backtrack so much. <br/><br/>We went in to see the Terracotta warriors, expecting to see a whole army but there were only a handful of them. Not too impressive if you had an army in mind!<br/><br/>The rest of the museum is very well done. The exhibits are interesting and the lighting and displays are very well kept."
mike66jakarta,230,Aug 2011,July 2011,50,Excellent!,"We came here during an event (July 31) and got 50% discount for entrance fee. The museum itself is well planned and very informative. I love the virtual tour guides who go to sleep when nobody touch the screen.<br/><br/>The permanent display are divided into several sections such as Middle East, India, Southeast Asia etc. The Terracotta warriors from China were also on display at that time and although not too many statues displayed (some were replica) it was very exciting for us. They will be here until October 2011. <br/><br/>If you are into history/culture then this museum is a must visit while in Singapore. My only complaint about this museum is there were too many guards roaming inside the museum watching your every move. Why don't they just use cctv to monitor visitors?"
limericklin,124,Aug 2011,August 2011,30,Plenty of information can be both a good and bad thing!,"This is the first time the terracotta warriors are exhibited in Singapore (and South East Asia). This exhibition features one hundred artefacts from Shaanxi province in China. Besides terracotta figures, the display contains important bronzes and jades from the the Qin state before the time of the First Emperor.<br/><br/>But it's not just history, history and history. I was pretty captivated by the installation by Justin Lee. It's titled Life After Death, which shows ""stylish terracotta warriors flanked by graceful fairy-like maidens armed with modern technologies.""<br/><br/>There is also the iPhone app which you could download. Unfortunately, the application didn't really load in time (perhaps due to slow connection) and I had left by the time the application finished loading. There's free wifi at the museum by the way.<br/><br/>There are also random stamp stations around the museum for you to emboss a bookmark. (not only for the children- adults were pretty fascinated by the stamp machine as well.)<br/><br/>After the walk around the terracotta exhibition, I decided to have a walk around the museum. Honestly, here is whether the dreariness of a hot afternoon sets in. The voice from the interactive screens start lulling me to sleep.<br/><br/>No, but that doesn't mean that the exhibitions are not good. Quite to the contrary, this place is a perfect location for people interested in different aspects of Asia.<br/><br/>It's just that the words in the explanatory booklets next to the exhibitions are excessive. I prefer the format of the terracotta exhibition, where you simply have a short introduction next to the exhibition itself. <br/><br/>Just a brief note on what else you can expect at the museum- information about the Singapore river (about trade and commerce at the Singapore River), South East Asia (religions, artefacts, textiles, performing arts), West Asia (religion) , China (Chinese culture, ceramics, paintings, calligraphies) and South Asia (religious artefacts).<br/><br/>The admission charges for this place is pretty cheap. It was free for me. There are many other forms of concessions so check if you qualify for any of them.<br/><br/>This is the perfect place for people interested in Asian culture, or history buffs, or people just finding an inexpensive way to spend your day.<br/><br/>Please refer to: http://rollingwrites.blogspot.com/2011/08/terracotta-warriors-exhibition-in.html for pictures at the ACM."
LL721,839,Jul 2011,July 2011,30,Interesting Terracotta Warriors exhibition,"Usually we don't visit museums. But this time we visited the Asian Civilisations Museum because of the Terracotta Warriors exhibition. It was not as big as we thought, though the exhibits shown there were very interesting. Liked the illustrations and also the areas where we could stamp our brochure with some Terracotta Warriors imprints.<br/>Thought the SGD8 per entry per adult was steep. Besides the Terracotta Warriors exhibit, we also went to the Singapore River exhibition."
alicevarren,365,Jun 2011,May 2011,50,Fantastic!,"I did not have this museum on my list of places to visit in Singapore; it was a rather random stop over. The museum, as I came to find out, is completely free. I found the set up and ambiance really one of a kind and quite original. In addition to well-spaced and well-explained displays, the museum makes a great use of lighting and background music to give certain moods. There are computer stations scattered throughout as well where you can learn more about any given artifact or subject. Since this was unplanned, I aim to come back and explore this museum more thoroughly."
sebhoff,878,Mar 2011,March 2011,50,Very well done - interesting exhibits,"Not a huge museum (e.g. like the Bangkok National Museum), but definitely worth a visit! They know how to do things well in Singapore - and this museum is no exception. Very good collection of significant artefacts from all over Asia, some stunning pieces of Islamic art, wonderful textiles, instructive videos and some hands-on exhibits for children. <br/>Most rooms are quite dark, with low light just about sufficiently illuminating the exhibits - difficult for photography unless you have a very fast lens.<br/>At the moment, admission (8 SGD) is 50% off if you have arrived in Singapore on Singapore Airlines."
scottcabal,325,May 2008,NA,40,A nice museum - worth a couple of hours,"The Asian Civilisations Museum is a museum at two sites showing you the history and culture of both Singapore and the entire region of South-East Asia. It has nothing there to make you want to spend the entire day like some museums around the world do but it has a nice collection of artifacts and exhibits that you won't find anywhere else and is worth visiting for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>We visited the Asian Civilisations Museum as part of the Footsteps of Raffles tour organised by Tour East. This gave us enough time to look round one of the sections but we never got a chance to see much other than the sections about Singapore itself, which I would have liked to have seen.<br/><br/>I suppose a good way to judge it is to take the Tour East tour I mentioned. You get to see the Museum as well as have a river cruise, tour a pewter factory, visit raffles hotel and have tea in addition to a nice overview tour of the city. Then if you like it just go back again later in the day and visit the other sections. You don't have to pay extra to visit it as part of the tour so you will only have to pay when you go back, if you decide to.<br/><br/>The building we visited is easy to find. It's in one of the old colonial buildings on the banks of the Singapore River right next to the famous statue of Sir Stamford Raffles.<br/><br/>If museums aren't your thing you probably won't enjoy this place. I'm not a person who likes spending all day in a museum but I enjoyed the brief time I spent in this one and would have liked to have seen the other sections."
ray_mcdonald,2,Mar 2008,NA,40,A definate Location to visit,When the people who were taking us to the Asian Civilisation Museum - I thought Oh No it will be boring - it was far from boring it is a must see. There was a display of Pope John Paul - it has never travelled to Australia so I am glad I went.
a60,739,Feb 2007,NA,40,Much better than I thought it would be,"I was dubious about going here but it was definitely worth it.  Apart from the great exhibits, the actual building it was housed in was fantastic.  Afterwards walk down to the river and have something to eat - a great way to spend an afternoon."
ariane123,267,Jul 2006,NA,40,A must-see in Singapore,"I enjoyed this museum much more than I thought I would to the extent that I'd say it's a 'must see' when you're in Singapore. The virtual tour guides are a great touch and even though they weren't properly operational during my trip, were still the source of some interesting information. There is, as other reviewers have noted, an awful lot of material here spanning the whole of South East Asia. Personally, I found the information on places I'd already visited much easier to contextualize (particularly the sections covering Peninsula Malaysia, Borneo and VietNam). The gift shop was also worthy of note being much larger than the average. I would certainly visit this museum again."
sandrajc,58,Jun 2006,NA,40,"Worthwhile visit to the Asian Civilizations Museum, Singapore",This is a very good museum which I wasn't going to visit at first because I thought the children (2 x 7 year olds and a 16 year old) might find a museum too boring.  The exhibits are colourful and interactive.  The twins occupied themselves activating all the talking modules which left me time to have a good look at the exhibits.  In the Islamic section there were opportunities for the children to copy Arabic script and in another part of the Museum watch shadow puppets.  All up it was a very interesting place to visit for all the family ranging from Grandparents through to 7 year olds.
Global18970,35,Apr 2005,NA,50,Excellent Musuem covering a very broad topic,"This is an excellent museum, but it covers a very broad area - from the Middle East to the Pacific Islands. So it can't go into real depth. But the variety of artifacts, and the explanations are excellent. Really going through thoroughly would take much of a day. Even the stairwells have some interesting plans showing the history of the building."
Companion7740,10,May 2004,NA,50,virtual tourguides and gorgeous artifacts,"I especially loved the stuff on the history of Singapore. Fascinating conglomeration of cultures there. There are tidbits of many different asian cultures here - not a whole lot of depth in any one of them. But the interpretive material is engaging and some of the artifacts are jaw-dropping. This was the only museum I went to while I was in Singapore, and it was definately worth it."

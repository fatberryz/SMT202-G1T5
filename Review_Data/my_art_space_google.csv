My team was deciding on a team bonding activity - Escape Room, paintball activity and this. We unanimously decided on My Art Space and it was the best decision. Not only did we bring the inner self on our creativity, but we got to bring home our own art pieces!",2019-04-24 10:31:42

The course package is very flexible and allows even office workers to enjoy painting at their own pace. The studio is spacious, well-lit and ventilated. The ambiance is exceptionally relaxing, great for an end-of-day recharge. Instructors pay careful attention and offer guidance suitable to each painter. Even as someone who's been painting for many years, I feel challenged and I am still learning new things with every class. I currently have an 8 week package and I'll definitely be extending it!",2018-09-08 07:43:35

Despite it being right in the center of a busy shopping area, My Art Space feels the complete opposite; it exudes a sense of peace and serenity. Surrounded by greenery with a beautiful view, the location is easily accessible. The introductory lesson was a mixture of theory and practical, interweaving philosophical views on painting which were useful when you come to paint. For example, when usual thoughts of doubt and self critical thoughts creep into the mind, the initial advice from the instructor would come in, reminding oneself to be patient and see with kindness one’s own painting. It was an overall lovely experience and I’m excited to start the 8 week workshop!",2018-07-23 10:40:12

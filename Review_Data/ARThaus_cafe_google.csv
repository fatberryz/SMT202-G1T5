Even though it was supposed to be guided, I would say the amount of guidance was definitely much less than expected. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, I guess there must be some form of freedom and exploration when it comes to art. But what do I know, I am an art idiot! Nonetheless, staff at Arthaus was very very friendly. Thanks for helping me touch up my terrible painting so it can be slightly more presentable and also for encouraging me by saying that it looks like modern art? Hahaha, I know it was just consolation but thanks. Would highly recommend Arthaus to anyone and definitely would promote it strongly to my friends and family. No scenic view from the premise but surrounded by art pieces that I look on with envy. No shortage of art tools as well.",2019-01-04 03:41:02

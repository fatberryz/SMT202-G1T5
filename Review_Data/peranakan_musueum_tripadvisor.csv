fiz S,71,5 Mar,March 2020,50,Perr-Aaa-Nak-Kan - A must to visit,A must to drop in. RM20 per person regardless local or non-local. But for RM20 it is definitely worth it. <br/><br/>Very intricate design of both the structure of the mansion and all its hidden gem. Will take you back to the 18th Century thru its precious antiques and historical photos. There are various elements of fusion between east meets west embedded in design of furnitures etc.<br/><br/>Time spent: 30 minutes up to 1 hour +<br/>Pay a little bit more attention on the details and you can see some hidden symbolism. <br/><br/>A must to drop in
Lynette M,7,Oct 2019,November 2018,40,"Explores the beliefs, culture and traditions of this important group in Singapore.","The museum explains the origin of the Peranakan culture. It was thoughtfully arranged with period exhibits and explored the groups beliefs, traditions and lifestyle. I found it very informative and well worth visiting."
ContinentsExplorer,816,Oct 2019,September 2019,40,Walking Tour in the heart of financial (central) district,Interesting walking trail to discover the Peranakan and different Chinese cultures and heritage. Museum is tacked away in the heart of the financial district. Artistic pieces (original) and option of replica design. Very limited street parking.
CHIDUWIN TV,627,Aug 2019,January 2019,30,Malaysian Museum,"Malaysian cultural museum. The museum has a huge collection of dresses and utensils and pictures, which poteays the detailed life of Malaysian Culture."
EmO,14,Aug 2019,August 2019,30,Beautiful but not for young children.,"Beautifully laid out and well maintained stately house. A lot to be learnt about the culture and heritage of the area. I think you could spend a long time here but with young children  it was hard and very hot inside, due to layout. <br/>It's reasonably priced though and the staff are helpful and friendly."
phi12017,102,May 2019,April 2019,40,Takes you back to a time long past -- a visual image of cultural intermingling of Chinese and Malays,"The term ""Peranakan"" is used in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore to refer to persons born in these countries of mixed local and foreign ancestry. “Foreign” could be  Arab, Chinese, Dutch, Indian, etc. Thus, the museum deals with artifacts and events associated with some form of foreign ancestry, in one way or another.<br/><br/>Because this museum was then  going to be closed very soon for rennovations,  I joined a group of six people visiting the museum in early April. The exhibits  revealed to me at least,  in a sparing way how some of the immigrant Chinese embraced and in a sense made their own, some of the practices of the indigenous Malays. They were also pictures of some former British colonial officers. <br/><br/>What emerged from the collection of exhibits is a revealing history of the not too distant past and the coming close to each other, or, even of the intermingling of some Asian cultures,  laced with European or British influences, on the fringes.  A visit to this museum is worth every minute spent to behold the varied collections of events, individuals, objects, etc.<br/><br/>All the pictures  are of exhibits on display in the museum and the copyright is with the Peranakan Museum or the actual owners of the exhibits, if  indeed they are on loan to the Museum."
JaR1983,204,Apr 2019,February 2019,50,A fascinating cultural experience,Ignorantly we knew nothing about the Peranakan culture but this museum was so interesting and gave superb examples of people's lives. Particularly liked the photographs. We followed the experience with a meal in a Peranakan restaurant. A superb day!
Mum0fTwo,106,Apr 2019,March 2019,50,Worth the visit,5 minutes walk from Bras Basah MRT station. Lots of interesting exhibits. Beautiful costumes and traditional garments on display. You can even dress up and take pictures. My 8 year old son learnt a lot about the Peranakan culture. Friendly and helpful staff. Toilets were very clean too. Glad I took my family here.
DW@Ballarat,"1,116",Apr 2019,March 2019,50,Excellent cultural heritage museum - pity its just closed for renovations,"This fascinating and well presented museum spread over three floors explains the heritage of Singapore with a mix of visual art, old furnishings, costumes, photographs and mocked up rooms. When it reopens take the opportunity to join a one hour guided tour of the museum as this will  add to your enjoyment of the museum."
mxgiosisca,37,Mar 2019,March 2019,40,Closing down for revamp from 2019,"Was my 2nd visit, and it was an enjoyable, peaceful time. Glad to hear they're not closing down for good, as they will be revamping content until 2021. The displays were well curated, and easy to follow. I hope they continue to preserve the Peranakan heritage here on out."
Hans V,883,Mar 2019,March 2019,40,Cultural Heritage very well explained and displayed.,Cultural Heritage very well explained and displayed. Mama Malay Nonya based insight clarifying a big Chunk of the Cultural blend now dominated in Singapore and enabling the coexistence of diversity.
kshitijsathe,64,Mar 2019,February 2019,50,Good informative place,Great place to know the history of Singapore and the various cultures it blends. The sections are very informative and the overall maintenance is up to date. Its a bit costly around 13 SGD
ahliao,448,Mar 2019,March 2019,40,Small but detailed exhibits ,"Just 3 floors, considered not big. However, the exhibits and set up makes me feel connected and soothing.<br/><br/>Spend just 45 mins. Colourful, well organised/segregated, meaningful explanations.<br/><br/>Found yr time to explore!"
fionnechong,7,Mar 2019,October 2018,50,Family educational tour,There are so much we didn't know about peranakan culture.  Really eye opening.  My kids love the colours of the peranakan porcelains and their accessories.
DSK,172,Mar 2019,February 2019,50,A Historian's 'Must See',Beautifully laid out museum telling the Peranakan history and development up to the present day. Friendly and efficient staff
Secret_Possum,353,Mar 2019,January 2019,40,Potted reconnection with Peranakan roots,"The concept of Peranakan culture is difficult to explain, so a trip to the Peranakan Museum was in order for my foreign-born princess. <br/><br/>Housed in what was an old school building, the Peranakan Museum was an easy - through sweaty - walk from the City Hall MRT station. Entry was a very affordable S$9 each (concession) for a senior and a student giving access to all the galleries, special exhibit Gambar (Malay word for photos) and a guided tour. We forwent the tour and decided to wander around by ourselves.<br/><br/>The exhibits were pretty static, housed as they were in glass cases or displayed behind roped off areas. The descriptions were illuminating, through this senior found the small font in the waist high plaques difficult to read, particularly in the diffuse lighting. <br/><br/>Despite this, they were fabulous props to explain Peranakan culture. And it was very evident that this museum is a labour of love and passion with a huge number of exhibits donated by prominent Peranakan families.<br/><br/>Our familial ties to Peranakan ways and culture are rather weak as the passion for the old ways was just not there, especially among the younger generations. The Great Grands, and Grands were tie-dyed Peranakan especially in their dressing and speech. But by my Mum’s generation, the women were all working for the then colonial British organisations, speaking English and in frocks and heels. No embroidered tops, sarongs and beaded slippers in sight!<br/><br/>A wander through the museum evoked waves of memories from my childhood of the rituals, customs, furniture, kitchen tools (like the huge granite spice grinders Grandmother used before the advent of the modern food processors), crockery, clothing, jewellery, accessories etc etc And also thoughts of “Hmmm I wonder what happened to Grandmother’s / Great-grand Aunty’s ... or I wonder who that was given to ....” plus, of course, “I have that, that and that ... from (this and that relative)” - all very precious, but impractical for everyday bar the most special occasions, unfortunately.<br/><br/>What I thought really well done was the display of the life cycle, from birth to weddings and funerals, which made it easier for princess to get a better understanding of Peranakan rituals.<br/><br/>This museum is well worth a few hours for those who would like an understanding of the term Peranakan and the history behind the unique Peranakan fusion cooking enjoyed throughout Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. <br/><br/>There is a tiny museum shop stuffed chock-full of Peranakan themed souvenirs beside the entrance if you want a momentous of your visit. We didn’t buy any as I have a small collection of authentic vintage items at home.<br/><br/>For those who would like to recreate authentic Peranakan dishes without the tedious hours of my great-grandmother’s and grandmother’s days, I suggest you seek out a copy of Modern Nonya cookbook by Sylvia Tan. This is the cookbook I refer to for authentic dishes simplified for the time-poor."
AKK1953,4,Feb 2019,February 2019,50,Hidden Gem,"Not highly advertised but this museum is a wonderful window into the Peranakan culture. Various galleries cover history, food, weddings and society. Really well laid out. Should be on the list of ‘must see’ museums for anyone with an interest in social history but is inviting and has plenty to offer the casual visitor. <br/>Current road construction work made it slightly difficult to find."
Kikka1931,260,Feb 2019,March 2018,50,"As a tourist/expat who likes to know more about the places you visit/live, you have to come here!","We went there with kids for an informative visit on the Peranakan culture - one of the most pervasive culture of this country - and we came out definitely satisfied!<br/><br/>LOCATION: it's in the city center, so easy to reach also with public transport (especially green/red line MRT). <br/><br/>PLACE: the building in which the museum resides was a school for more or less 100 years, so already this building sets the scene for what you are going to see inside. <br/><br/>EXPERIENCE: we knew it was possible to get a volunteer to guide our visit (please check on the internet the hours of the slots if you are interested) so we approached the staff at the desk on the groudfloor and they smilingly asked us to wait for a while at the designated area. Then after a few minutes the guide arrived and accompanied us in all the rooms, explaining the history and every-day life of this specific culture. Very nice indeed! Another very good feature was that the kids had their own maps where you could get stamps onto in each room: these kept the little folks entertained as we were!<br/><br/>TO SUM UP: if you are a person who likes to really explore the culture of the places you visit and not simply 'tick' areas.....this is one of the places to go!"
concorde7,110,Feb 2019,September 2018,40,Something different,This is quite different and also very informative.<br/>Nice and cool inside something that is welcome on a hot day in Singapore.<br/>You can spend a couple of hours before you know it.
James L,60,Jan 2019,January 2019,50,Informative,"Very nicely sectioned.  Day we went was not crowded, can browse at leisure within air-conditioned facility.  Recommend to visit museums in renovated mansions &amp; houses, along with this one.  Soak it all in."
LSL,120,Jan 2019,January 2019,50,Fascinating,Not your average museum. Another historical view of Singapore culture and diversity. Well laid out. Excellent exhibits. Worth going for a tour
patrizia l,288,Jan 2019,November 2018,50,Knowing the Culture - living between cultures,"This is a a beautiful and very interesting Museum about the diverse Peranakans. We met a lady in the Arab District in a shop house. She had wonderful artefacts in the shop. She introduced us to the Peranakan Culture and told us stories of her family and how they lived. The museum was her recommendation. It is in an old Shophouse on two or three levels. Grund floor with photos of the mix cultures of Peranakans. One family part coming from Malawian Background the other either European or Chinese. The Fusion of both worlds in education, beliefs, traditions is shown in many ways. It is a journey to a different world. We had the previledge to join a guide tour and we learned so much. Great Exhibition."
Penny C,32,Dec 2018,December 2018,50,A museum not to be missed,"What a lovely museum to visit, so interesting to know &amp; see the history &amp; the beaded shoes are just amazing.  Plenty to see &amp; do while there &amp; the gift shop downstairs to the right of the building when you exit is worth a visit too."
JennJenn C,45,Dec 2018,March 2018,50,A beautifully made Peranakan Museum,I just stroll around from Golden Mile complex heading to the Merlion Park. And passed by at this place. This is so nice not to be appreciated.
SDM88,102,Dec 2018,December 2018,50,Excellent highlights tour,"Visited on a weekend and joined one of the free highlight tours. Lots to see and a beautiful collection but really brought to life by Ian, our tour guide. He was brilliant! Well worth a visit"
Witoldzio,563,Nov 2018,November 2018,50,excellent,This is a museum devoted to Peranakan culture and all aspects of it. I liked the exhibits very much and the relaxing feel to the building. Very friendly staff. The exhibits focus on the customs and art of that ethnic group. Fascinating to be able to get an insight into the social and cultural fabric of Singapore.
angelinat202,75,Nov 2018,October 2018,50,Insightful and educational,"We had a most interesting afternoon going around the museum, learning about the history and cultural heritage of perankan culture. Such lovely and lively displays to show off such a great culture. A must visit for sure."
Kate A,32,Nov 2018,November 2018,40,For museum fans and/or those wanting to understand peranakan culture.,"Disappointed this cost more than the fabulous Asian Civilisation Museum, but beside that, definitely worth a visit. Gorgeous old building and rickety floor boards! The staff were helpful and friendly. <br/><br/>The actual displays were fabulous. My son learned a lot about funerals and weddings from the displays. I felt incredibly teary at the photos at the entrance. Such pride in one's culture is a beautiful thing. <br/><br/>A rich and well preserved photographic exhibition was on the 2nd and 3rd floors. Each photo gave a literal snap shot of life for the Peranakan in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Stretched from the early days of photography, all the way to the current era. The film showing the cleaning of some items was incredibly interesting. So much a labour of love."
Jhud69,76,Oct 2018,October 2018,50,A Delightful Quaint Museum full of Interesting Art and Artefacts of the Peranakan Era.,"The museum is housed in a delightful historical building and building, entry is by a small fee.  Inside the museum has a vast array of knowledge being shared on the well curated art, ceramics and furniture.  Everything has been well preserved and maintained. The old B/W photos of people add nostalgia whilst depicting life at the time. This museum i not glamorous like some attractions, but shines in it's simple beauty off the past."
lakshmi f,17,Oct 2018,October 2018,40,Wonderful corner of old Singapore ,"I had a few hours to kill in Singapore when I decided to visit this museum. <br/>It’s easy to find, despite the building works all around. The entrance is stunning , and the reception staff were welcoming. <br/>I enjoyed a glimpse into the various aspects of Peranakan life - I especially enjoyed pictures of people who speak of what their heritage means to them in 2018. <br/>The wedding and death rituals were very well curated and explained. <br/>I wa also impressed by the range of photographs from old Singapore, depicting the life and customs of Pernanakans from the 1800s. The collection of cameras was a treat !<br/>This museum is worth a visit."
Renaud M,204,Oct 2018,October 2018,40,Great dive in the history of the people of Singapore,"Very nice museum and excellent presentations on the origins and the ways of life of the people of Singapore. Great way to learn about the Peranakan and better understand why Singapore is such a cosmopolitan city! Worth a visit. Not too long and diverse presentations through videos, exhibits, photos. Don’t miss it!"
Belinda H,96,Oct 2018,October 2018,40,Comprehensive and interesting ,"Well set out in lovely old building. Good, well organised displays with helpful explanations. Air conditioned. Low entrance fee. Worth a visit."
Mazmannan,"9,057",Oct 2018,April 2018,40,Peranakan culture and history,"The Peranakan Museum is a must for all those who are interested in culture and history of Singapore. The museum is located in Armenian Street and is housed on three floors in a very beautiful building.<br/><br/>The culture and heritage of the Peranakan people is well documented in the museum. Everything from food, clothing, furniture, carpets, weddings, jewelry, and much more is there. The exhibits are well laid out and the descriptions are very good and easy to understand. <br/><br/>I found this museum very interesting - and time passed by very quickly. You should plan on spending between two to three hours.<br/><br/>I would recommend a visit to this museum.<br/><br/>The museum is open daily from 10am to 7pm. On Fridays, it is open from 10am to 9pm. Singaporeans and permanent residents go free. Foreigners and tourists admission fee is SGD10. On Fridays, from 7pm to 9pm the admission fee is SGD5. Senior citizens and elders pay SGD6 - and on Fridays pay SGD3 between 7pm and 9pm."
crullerpastry,20,Sep 2018,September 2018,50,A priority when visiting Singapore...,"I had an interest in the historical role of the Peranakan people in the growth of Singapore as a colonial trading port under British rule. This museum deals with that but is more interesting insofar as it explores the varied origins of the Peranakan, the emergence of their unique hybrid culture (e.g. wedding etiquette, food, furniture, etc) and their importance in Singaporean civil society. A fascinating museum with well curated and annotated exhibits. It's relatively inexpensive and, if you plan appropriately (which I didn't!), you can take advantage of the free guided tour. Worth checking out before you go. Conveniently located near City Hall MRT station. Bras Basah close if on Circle Line. Allow at least 1.5 hours."
Aprilflame,105,Sep 2018,August 2018,50,Wholesome view of the Peranakans,A must visit for those interested in the Peranakan culture and heritage.  Peranakan is often misunderstood to only represent those of mixed Chinese and Malay heritage i.e. the Baba and Nyonyas but the museum shows that it encompasses a wider group. It provides a wholesome showcase of daily lives and important ceremonies such as weddings and a funeral. An educational place to spend 2-3 hours on a sunny afternoon..
ianshamshey,907,Sep 2018,September 2018,40,very interesting-worth a visit!,"I was not aware of what the term ""Peranakan"" meant. In the past, Southeast Asia was an opportunity for trade and wealth and lured people to the area. Many stayed, married local women and the children of these unions are called Peranakans. Most are Chinese but could also be Arab, Eurasian and Indian. This museum details Peranakan art and objects and the various galleries outline their ethnic customs such as weddings, language and fashion, religion, public life and foods. It is very interesting to visit if you have the time. It is on three floors and there is an elevator for those who cannot negotiate the stairs"
little_peg,147,Sep 2018,September 2018,50,Amazing,"Singapore has people with different nationality living together. The child of local woman of singapore and other ethnic origins is called ""Peranakan"".  The museum gives me better understanding of Peranakans by guided tour and lots of exhibits,  not just watch them but can be touched. It is an incredible museum."
Jeanne H,130,Sep 2018,December 2017,40,Very good if you time your visit when a volunteer guide is present,"I personally prefer this Museum to our National Museum. Find the latter to be a bit overwhelming, too much text, though still worth visiting if you are interested in an in depth understanding of Singapore's history.  The Peranakan Museum is interesting mainly due to its content, the focus on the Peranakans, whose culture is  unique and an interesting combination of Malay and Chinese culture.  If you check the website, you can find out when the volunteer guides will be on hand.  From what I understand, they are usually Peranakans themselves, and so both knowledgeable and enthusiastic."
GeneralShamu,532,Sep 2018,August 2018,40,Worth a Visit History Wise,Very interested to learn about the history of the people of the Straits Settlements. Probably need 1.5 hours to see it all (max).
Gary D,630,Sep 2018,July 2018,40,Great insight into the Races of Singapore,"Really didn't understand the word Peranakan, and trip here clarified this for us. Well laid out Museum, in a resplendent old Building, with plenty to look at from the racial mixes, through displays of weddings, Fashion, Religion, Food and day to day living. <br/>Very comfortable to do in the heat of the day, well laid out and detailed.we are better informed now than prior to visiting. Worth a look if you have some interest in early singaporian life."
cyc326,35,Aug 2018,August 2018,40,good place to explore peranakan elements,"Had my last visit during the Night Festival 2018. A museum well preserved and telling stories of peranakan (historically mix of Chinese and Malay heritage). Had a corner at ground floor for visitors to take IG photos with the props available-- fun! Just beware of visiting the wedding rooms (level 1) with mannequins wearing traditional peranakan outfit at night time, as it could get a bit eerie (better to go at daytime?!)... overall, worth another visit when got longer time for the details."
Nancy P,476,Aug 2018,April 2018,50,Outstanding,"Fascinating history combined with beautiful furnishings and other samples of artistry make this our favorite museum so far.  We lucked upon this museum while attending a street festival, and were very happy we did.  The worksmanship ranging from beadwork to furniture details are lovely."
TheOExpress,"2,842",Aug 2018,August 2018,40,Take a tour if possible.,"The entry fee of SG$13 is best justified if you take a tour, which I did and lasted about an hour. In terms of the exhibits, many are stunning and really informative though I felt that the ‘weddings’ section was a little large when I would have liked to learn about other aspects of Peranakan culture. For example: the differences  between and similarities of the different groups. Still definitely worth visiting though, especially for the first room on the left when you go in, which covers the history and modern life of these communities"
KGB777,"38,048",Aug 2018,August 2018,40,Return to the Peranakan Museum,"We came back here for another visit after a gap of nearly 4 years. It's still free for Singaporeans and PRs and is well worth the effort of visiting. $13 for foreigners is a bit steep, but is perhaps worth it if you would like to get a better understanding of the Peranakan history of Singapore. Plenty of interesting exhibits to see here, although not that interesting for children."
vic10101,410,Aug 2018,August 2018,40,Worthwhile to those interested in Singaporean Chinese culture,"This is about the culture, customs and practices of Singaporean Chinese (Peranakan) including those married to other races. You need a good guide to explain to you the various stories connected with certain facets such as matrimony matters. But if you are not interested in these things, then the displays may not mean much to you."
FalconWix,13,Aug 2018,July 2018,40,Insightful,"Though it is only three stories high and not as big as compared to other museums, it provides a glimpse into the Peranakan culture within Singapore that has become less predominant today and allows one to appreciate the culture and heritage."
Ifan I,2,Aug 2018,August 2018,40,A fascinating place to celebrate diverseness and mixed culture,"The term peranakan itself embraces the cultural fact of living in Southeast Asia: you can't be racially pure, whatever that means. One is almost certain comes from a long line of mixed culture and heritages. Although mainly about Chinese settlers (as it was and is with Singapore), we can learn a lot about a peculiar mix of Chinese, Indian and Malay (and countless others such as Java, Bugis, Boyan/Bawean, Arabs, etc.) culture."
Grant R,103,Jul 2018,January 2018,40,Understanding this unique culture,I took my family to this and it was well worth the effort.  My primary school children were really interested in the how the older Singaporeans used to live.  The articles on display are brilliant.  The guide tried to make it sound as though all were Peranakan's were rich but this isn't quite true.  Nothing like telling the story how you wish it to be!.  But still very good.
BusinessBear,150,Jul 2018,July 2018,40,Good insight into the history of Peranakan,Located in fabulous old building the museum offers an insight into the history of the Peranakan. There are various themed displays across the 3 levels and is worth a visit
Beagles42,27,Jul 2018,June 2018,40,Very interesting insight into Singapore history,"This museum is a well-set-out exploration of the mingling of cultures through Singapore's history, with informative displays and AV explanations. It was an unexpected gem!"
Michele H,114,Jul 2018,July 2018,50,Excellent!,"For some history of Singapore and her people, this is a must see. Very well presented and very interesting."
-ChellesM-,11,Jul 2018,July 2018,20,"As a Peranakan myself, I was disappointed","I was so excited to finally get to go to the Peranakan Museum. <br/><br/>As a Peranakan myself, I was hoping for a home coming feel, to wander the halls and relive the glory days of Peranakan culture and history.<br/><br/>Instead, what I got were glass showcases after glass showcases of sterile displays of very few of each item. This was definitely not experiential.<br/><br/>I think it would be better if the Museum transformed the areas into what a real Peranakan Household would have looked like with a separate floor for celebrations.<br/><br/>It would be wonderful to walk through a recreated Peranakan Hall, kitchen, bedroom ... a real feel of how Peranakans of yore used to live.<br/><br/>Manequins dressed in Peranakan outfits going about the daily life of a Peranakan, cooking, talking in the living room, eating dinner with all the Peranakan crockery laid out.<br/><br/>I hope the Museum will do real justice to such a rich and unique culture and not present the culture in such a clinical manner."
ochassot,967,Jul 2018,June 2018,40,Good introduction to Singapore,The Peranakan Museum offers a nice introduction to the history and culture of Singapore in an old colonial-era building.
Wingecarribee,"1,499",Jun 2018,June 2018,40,Cultural displays,"Worth a visit. Easily accessible, near Fort Canning park. Nice displays with a wealth of information about the Peranakan culture and history. Clothing, art, furniture, jewellery, dining settings, cuisine, everyday objects, etc. Includes a very informative section on photography and photographic equipment. The beadwork tablecloth is amazing. Several levels and includes activities for the kids."
JK888,100,Jun 2018,April 2018,40,Best place to know the Peranakan culture.,"If you wonder how interesting is the Peranakan culture?<br/>You will find the unique culture of Chinese and Malay in this Peranakan museum, from arts to sculpture to all little parts of daily life of this two communities.<br/>So don't miss it if you like unique art culture and the ticket is not expensive at all."
Minami K,12,Jun 2018,July 2017,40,2016.9,You are able to touch the Peranakan culture and the history. You can also see the beautiful manufacturers.
Mak Semarangan,4,Jun 2018,September 2017,50,Museum Peranakan Singapore,"a great place to get to know the history of human civilization, especially Chinese peranakan in Singapore. The place is clean and elegant to visit."
LeaveOnlyBubbles,121,Jun 2018,June 2018,50,Hidden gem in the heart of the city...,"We've headed there as we wanted to let the kids take part in the children's activities that day but found ourselves spending longer than expected due to the kids being engrossed with the art &amp; craft activities there.<br/><br/>Access is via City MRT, which is linked to more central lines than the Bras Brasah station.<br/><br/>Try to head there every first Sunday (Straits Family Sunday) of each month as there will be more activities and an opportunity for a full on dress up photoshoot via authentic Peranakan attire for the whole family.."
Patty6-13,522,Jun 2018,May 2018,40,Interesting historical perspective,"I enjoyed a couple hours here learning more about the multi cultural history of Singapore. Exhibits are well labeled and there are some wonderful family photos of yesteryear,"
Huang Wzhong,481,Jun 2018,April 2018,50,Peranakan museum that worth for anyone visiting,"one of the best Museum in ASEAN countries that has present the Peranakan dedicated stories.<br/><br/>the small medium size museum, but it has compacted with a lot of valuable information that suitable for any people can bring their own family member to visit this place and share some cultural experience together.<br/><br/>I have never expected that I can see so many beautiful precious collection of Chinese porcelain ware (during late Qing dynasty) in this exhibition. <br/><br/>the museum is well organized, this is the precious valuable place and definitely, it's worth for visiting."
guy m,83,Jun 2018,June 2018,40,Really interesting place,"This museum celebrates multiculturalism before the term was invented with a really interesting display of cultural fusing in Asia; food,clothing and traditions! It is well curated and very informative"
Norm the Nomad,455,May 2018,September 2017,30,Good for a ‘slower or wet day’,After a frantic few days of exploring Singapore the Museum is a welcome rest stop. At a slower pace it offers the chance to see some of Singapore’s history. It is very good and one should plan on allowing 2 - 3 hours here to get value. Recommended.
tsukuba,20,May 2018,April 2018,50,"Cute and informative, almost a MUST","Very interesting discoveries can be made here. Might be useful to combine with the national museum visit. Children interested in history, fabrics, daily life can benefit too - interactive exhibits. A small but very well packed, interesting and colourful museum, not crowded and I would say a MUST."
Katetherat,136,May 2018,September 2017,50,Love this museum,If you have any interest in the history of Singapore and the Peranakan people then this is the place to immerse yourself in the culture. I think it is a must do iwhen in Singapore
Robert T,490,May 2018,May 2018,50,Really interesting,Had an excellent guide and this story really came to life. Learned a lot. Not overwhelming in its scale but fascinating insights into a previously unknown culture to me.
WNFdiary,346,May 2018,April 2018,50,Peranakan style is a real eye candy!,"We love all that is related to Peranakan, the incredible hand-crafted furniture, beautiful clothing, tableware... That is a museum that we found absolutely delightful and we highly recommend the guided tour. In short time you'll find a lot about Chinese straits and probably the visit to this museum will stick with you longer than expected. We visited quite a few places in Singapore and wrote about them on our blog. Maybe there is something that will inspire your next trip to this amazing city. Singapore has many charming places and the Peranakan Museum is definitely one of them."
melach9_2009,66,May 2018,May 2018,50,A great insight to the Peranakan culture,Finally after three visits to Singapore we found time to visit this interesting attraction to get an insight into the Peranakan culture.<br/>This was previously a school which was very well converted in a tourist attraction. We were lucky enough to time our visit to catch the free conducted tour of the museum which lasted nearly and hour. It definitely made the visit to the Museum an interesting one. There are sufficient interesting exhibits to keep you there longer if you want to.
Min L,20,May 2018,May 2018,50,"Cutest little museum with an excellent, informative tour guide!","I was very intrigued and impressed by this museum. Small and concise, it was full of sweetness and rich in culture and history. I highly recommend taking the guided tour - it is one of the best museum tours I have ever been on, as it was engaging, informative, and insightful. Definitely worth visiting, and revisiting!"
ellyzack,26,May 2018,May 2018,50,Enriching Experience ,The Peranakan museum goes in detail about the history and the culture of Peranakans. It explains every aspect and it is a definitely something interesting and different from your normal museums. <br/><br/>I'd recommend going for the free guided tours so to better understand the displays.
novita77,52,Apr 2018,April 2018,50,Insightful tour guide,"Visited Singapore for a week, I lived in Singapore between 1999 to 2001, I am a 'Peranakan' (straits chinese) my self.  When I arrived at the museum, just in time for the start of guided tour, It was utterly charming and interesting listening to knowledgeable tour guide Chay Cheng Lim explaining in details about peranakan way of life. <br/><br/>The museum is not big, i would recommend 2 hours maximum to see everything. <br/><br/>The place is easy to find, took MRT to Raffles Place and did a little bit of walk with my google map on my phone. <br/><br/>If you have an hour or two to spare defenitely recommend this place to explore."
worldtraveller99,"2,268",Apr 2018,April 2018,50,Lovely small museum,"This is a really sweet museum, all about the history and culture of the Peranakan people in Singapore. There are lots of beautiful artefacts, some of which you can buy in the gift shop on site. An enjoyable hour or so."
DC2florida,379,Apr 2018,April 2018,40,Nice introduction to the Peranakan in Singapore,"After seeing similar displays in Penang, Malaysia, it was nice to see how the communities differed here in Singapore. The displays are great and it is nice they have objects you can touch for all (you do not have to be visually impaired or a child to learn from such exhibits!). The handcrafts are just incredible."
Arrjun,225,Apr 2018,April 2018,40,Highlights an obscure aspect of world history,"As a history buff, visiting this museum brought alive to me the history of the Peranakan people - who are otherwise unknown outside of the South East Asian region. The museum - through artifacts, personal accounts and larger histories - showcases details of the Peranakan community at an overall level and also dwells on personal details, giving a full picture of these people and how they have grown with the region. <br/>One word of caution - this is strictly if you are interested in history or in culture, unless you happen to be a Peranakan yourself."
susantN8524LZ,209,Apr 2018,April 2018,40,The Singapore Peranakan Museum-a showcase of Peranakan history and culture,"The Peranakan Museum at the site of the former Tao Nan School Building, 39 Armenian Street is the place to visit if you need to know about the Peranakans. Unlike the Penang Peranakan Museum (Mansion) which has much more Peranakan  artefacts, the Singapore Peranakan Museum showcase the history of the Peranakan people - their origin and house a modest size of the Peranakan living furniture- here it is a showcase with historical facts-very well  presented by the guide (we had a English guided tour – Mandarin, Japanese and French guides are available at different time slots). Peranakan comes from the root Malay word ‘anak’ which means son of – ie the Peranakans are descendants of Chinese traders married to local women in SEAsia – mainly Penang, Malacca, Singapore and Indonesia. Go try the Peranakan cuisine after the visit - at the Peranakan restaurant True Blue next-door"
740Elly48,443,Mar 2018,November 2017,40,Aamazing,Very interesting museum. The displays and explanations are very well done. We spent quite a bit of time absorbing the history of these people.
Justin K,278,Mar 2018,March 2018,50,Great introduction into this unique culture,"I came here on a free weekend and found the visit fascinating and highly educational. It is a must for anyone who has an interest in the overseas Chinese and Indian traders who created their own unique culture in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>The museum is not too large and would require about 1.5 to 2 hours to visit. Free tours are available but all exhibits are well described with English captions and explanatory notes so a tour is not necessary. I would particularly recommend this hotel if you are fortunate enough to be traveling to either Malacca or Penang in Malaysia both of which have preserved Peranakan mansions. This museum would help you get a feel and understanding of the culture which will help you better appreciate those sites. If you are just in Singapore though this museum will help give you the basic flare for these intrepid travelers who left their homelands and traveled to Southeast Asia to trade. Their culture is a fascinating blend of Chinese and Southeast Asia influences which you can see from their ceremonies, traditions, dress, and even porcelain kitchen ware."
sw6sw6,32,Mar 2018,March 2018,50,"Informative, free guided tour","The Peranakan Museum houses a modest size collection of cultural artefacts, with comprehensive explanations in English. A very informative guided tour is offered in English numerous times a day (also available in other languages) which I could helpful as my knowledge of the culture was minimal in advance of visiting. Definitely worth visiting if you're interested  in cultures and decorative arts."
keefw,320,Mar 2018,March 2018,40,Excellent Guide,"We found this museum just across from our hotel and found our guided tour very interesting,with plenty of very good information on the Peranaken community."
fire-tower,"1,616",Mar 2018,March 2018,50,Rich in its collection and displays,"This is a smaller museum housed in a pre-war building that was formerly a school. While small, it is rich in its collection and displays. You can see intricate items worn in the old days, and the gift shop sells reproduction of the beautiful porcelain pieces. Try to join the guided tours to better understand the items on display as well as the unique Peranakan culture, and explore the museum thereafter.  Take a walk outside the building to admire the well-maintained structure as well."
moderntraveler,488,Mar 2018,February 2018,40,"Rich in culture, traditional wear, intricate furniture","If you like any of the above, it will be interesting for you. $10 for tourists and $6 for students (with valid id) and senipr citizens, it introduces the peranakan culture and its people, cultures and customs.<br/><br/>Loved the beadwork, intricate furniture and traditional clothing especially the flower prints and antelop embroidered top.<br/><br/>Has guided tours for several languages, so i recommend you go online and book a tour to have more fun with a guide bringing you around. More tours on weekends."
PeterLanky,816,Feb 2018,February 2018,50,Take a guided tour,"An interesting museum on its own, but made more interesting by our guided tour courtesy of Eugene. The one hour tour somehow became a 2 hour tour, such was his enthusiasm for the place.<br/><br/>Easy to find just off Hill Street close to the Armenian Church, with the Hill Street bus stops close by."
TheAplinsPerth,15,Feb 2018,February 2018,40,Worthwhile visiting!,"A very interesting museum where we learnt a lot about the Peranakan history and culture. There were lots of interesting displays with beautiful embroidery, ceramics and furniture. Patricia our guide was very informative and keen to impart her knowledge about the key elements of Peranakan life."
CraigM88,166,Feb 2018,February 2018,40,"Interesting Museum, but not top 5 for me","I visited on my own and had a guided tour by a Dutch lady in English. It was a good tour and went through some of the key elements of Chinese Paranakan culture. The museum doesn’t cover Indian or Arab Paranakan culture, which is a shame. <br/><br/>It’s an interesting couple of hours for sure, and at $10 for an adult, not too pricey, and the tours are included that run at 11am and 2pm daily. I’d recommend going for a tour and then wondering around yourself afterwards for a bit if you want time to look at the exhibitions in more detail. <br/><br/>The Asian Cultures Museum gave me more background on the development of Singapore, cultural and otherwise, but this does give a more generic cultural background which is also interesting. Overall, worth a visit, but if you only have a couple of days, I would prioritise seeing other museums."
Jaqui T,30,Feb 2018,February 2018,30,Good museum,I visited this museum at the end of a very busy few days and so don't think I gave it enough time.  Good museum but will definitely visit again when I have a free few hours.
cmcna12,220,Feb 2018,February 2018,40,Spent an enjoyable couple of hours....,"Enjoyed this museum - interesting history around the building and also the museum.  Very good guided tour....Beautiful examples of ceramics, embroidery and fashion."
Schubert Á,32,Feb 2018,February 2018,50,WHO were the real singapourians? ,"Absolutely helpful place to understand how Singapour was born, how its habitants used to live, where they came from, what does it mean to be Nyonya etc.<br/>Fantastic guided tour by an airship ingenieur, voluntering, spent hours inside."
Helge D,121,Feb 2018,November 2017,50,Must visit in Singapore,"A lovely museum that explains effortlessly various aspects of Peranakan culture. The main exhibition is organised according to important traditional life events, which makes it easy to grasp and very entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the part of the exhibition located in the ground level, where different people of Peranakan origin explain what being Peranakan means to them."
Georjina C,56,Feb 2018,February 2018,20,Below average,"We were very disappointed at the displays at the museum and the content inside. It did not feel complete and was very stiff. There was an imbalance of artifacts and there was lots of embroidery which was scattered everywhere and it seemed like the were space fillers. The individual dioramas and displays were very meagre and the topic of music and pantuns was missing. We also noticed that the in the display for the wedding procession, the two boys in front were wearing modern sarongs and looked very fake. I went to the Peranakan museum when it was in Emerald Hill and felt that it was a more cohesive display than what is now at Tao Nan."
Sparking G,192,Jan 2018,January 2018,40,Above expectations ,"We didn’t expect the museum to be so informative. We only allocated 1 hour to spend at the museum before our dinner appointment. To our surprise, we needed more time if we were to read the interesting explanations/descriptions of the displays. <br/>Lovely exhibits. Though not many but sufficient to give the full picture of peranakan culture. <br/>Worth visiting especially it is free for SG citizens and PRs."
baxter034,246,Jan 2018,November 2017,40,Excellent insight into peranakan culture,"This small museum is full of interesting items and displays to educate the visitor on peranakan culture, well worth the visit"
sharonr806,279,Jan 2018,January 2018,50,wonderful tour on a Sunday afternoon,"I arrived on a Sunday afternoon when admission was free and there were many guided tours available. My guide, Ms. Heng Xiang Hui gave a 'wedding' focused tour which I enjoyed very much. The museum is well laid out and informative. Unfortunately the gift shop had loud Western music blaring and I chose not to spend time looking for gifts, but I was disappointed with the lack of quality products in the shop."
immaize,39,Jan 2018,October 2017,50,Must visit!,"There's so much to see and learn on the Peranakan history &amp; culture here. There's always some new exhibition linking to Peranakan around the world is held here. you'll never be bored here, that's for sure!"
Nossi,254,Jan 2018,October 2017,50,An all-time favourite,"Gives a good overview of Peranakan culture which, in turn, helps visitors (at least this one) better understand the unique blend of cultures that makes Singapore so special. Well worth a visit."
Groundnuts,424,Jan 2018,December 2017,40,Very Nice,"Walked passed this along the street and surprise it was free for locals. Was amazed with the displays, were all very nicely presented. Not a big place but good enough to understand the culture of the Nyonyas."
Elizabeth h,76,Jan 2018,February 2017,50,A MUST VISIT,I visit the museum when there's a special exhibition for embroidery and that was absolutely amazing! The details and collections show how great the crafts around Asia. You will learn the peranakan customs as well it's quite interactive and fun way to learn the culture.
ozgeizci,4,Jan 2018,January 2018,50,Cheap museum with deep meaning,"Some museums in Singapore charge up to 40 SGD so I was surprised to see Peranakan is only 10 SGD. It displays the cultural life and history of the Peranakan community. I almost read every text on the walls and my visit took around an hour and a half. It is a relatively small museum. Kids friendly. Walking distance to Little India, you can plan your visit accordingly."
bemusedtraveller,194,Jan 2018,January 2018,30,Nice concept but a little disappointing ,Some nice ideas and displays such as the introductory gallery on the ground floor. Beautiful old building. <br/>However displays a bit sparse and poorly lit. The signs were in three languages but very dim lighting and the positioning so low to the ground (much less than hip height) meant I had to bend double to read them. I didn’t bother after the first few. I suppose the height is good for children but not for a tall person.
EaglevisionLowe,278,Jan 2018,February 2017,50,RotaryClub friends ,Large group of Raffles City Rotary club members and visiting rotarians asean were taken on a conducted tour of this wonderful collection of Peranakan artifacts showcasing the culture and history of this unique southeast Asian minority’s in bygone days.
Xiamenwecl,8,Jan 2018,January 2018,50,Spent a fascinating 2 hours here.,"This museum is dedicated to the (mostly Chinese ) group of Peranakan people. I opted for the guided tour, which today was lead by Angelika. She was full of enthusiasm and knowledge about the Peranakan people and  their origins and customs. Their origins, while shrouded in mystery began hundreds of years ago with trading ships coming to the area from places such as India, the Muslim world and of course China. Some of the traders stayed to marry local women and their descendants are the Peranakans.  The museum itself has lots of artifacts showing the life of this group over time. It's a fascinating history of a multicultural group that has stood the test of time. Their religious, food, dress, wedding and birth customs to name a few are portrayed with exhibits given to the museum. Beautiful pieces of art, clothing , furniture and wedding customs are on display and their significance well documented and explained. The building itself is a beautiful piece of architecture , well worth exploring. I enjoyed my time here and left with some good basic knowledge of the history of one group of Singaporeans. Well worth a visit."
Esther R,657,Jan 2018,January 2018,50,Nice,Well... i come with my friend from the nerest mrt Telok Ayer exit A. Walk along the street about 10 minutes to get there.
Seunghong M,13,Jan 2018,December 2017,40,Easy understanding on many Singaporeans,"We visited this small but quite nice museum in Fec 2017. If you want to know about the cultures of the majority of Singaporean people, this place will help you quickly understand what Pernakan is and how they formulate a unique community in Singapore.  From their marrage, furniture, food, clothings to religions, this museum exhibits their cultures and heritages in a historic building. The neighborhood is also calm and cozy to walk. Good for children as well."
Darina C,94,Dec 2017,December 2017,40,Interesting museum in a beautiful building,My friend brought me to the Peranakan museum. I thought it was a fairly interesting one to visit if you're into cultures and heritage. I learnt a lot about the origins and traditions of Peranakan people which is pretty interesting as I grew up surrounded with some influence of Peranakan culture and food. <br/><br/>You can do the tour in a couple of hours and its a great place to bring kids as well as there are activities for the kids to do as you go through the exhibit. I loved how some of the stations were interactive which made it more interesting (for a non-history buff).
Lee S,12,Dec 2017,December 2017,40,Visit on 16 Dec 2017,"Go for the guided tour! My doscent, Thomas Tay was engaging, knowledgable about Peranakan culture and made the tour really informative and interesting! Some of the exhibits are lavish and beautiful. Well worth a visit."
Alan M,44,Dec 2017,November 2017,50,A highlight of our days in Singapore,We enjoyed a guided tour by a volunteer was was both interesting and entertaining as he took us thorugh the various sectiosn of this wonderfully presented museum.  A proud Peranakan he made the museum 'come alive' for us.<br/><br/>Make the effort to see this exceptional museum.
noadear,36,Dec 2017,December 2017,30,Nice,"Nice and colorful place. For those who come after the big museums, like me, this museum is a bit lost. There are two guided tours a day at 11am and at 2pm."
Rootz,226,Dec 2017,December 2017,50,Enriching place with insights to the rich history of peranakans. ,"If you are interested in the history of peranakans, this is the must go to place. There are tons of information which will help to let you know on the rich history of peranakans in Singapore.<br/><br/>Various galleries with different themes help to make it easy for people to understand.<br/><br/>Tour is suitable for family and usually no more than 3 hours. If you happen to come by here, do check out the stamp museum which is just around the corner too."
cherietomkins,88,Dec 2017,November 2017,50,Learnt a lot,"We were told to go there and what an amazing place and I learnt a lot, the guide was very easy to understand which was great and she explained so much would go herecagain"
2morrows,435,Nov 2017,November 2017,50,Outstanding Historic Family Home,"The Peranakan Mansion Museum is an historic family home in Penang. This site is easily walked to in about 15 minutes from the port. The admission has to be paid in RM or SK $ as they don't accept US $ here. You can take an excellent 45 minutes guided tour in English which is included in the price and well worthwhile.  The house consists of a number of  rooms all set up as it was many years ago.  There are also displays of fine antiques, jewelry, costumes, artifacts and even a indoor temple. Remember to go early as it closes at 5:00."
Aryo Bimo Notohadikoesoemo,233,Nov 2017,November 2017,50,The History of The Chinese Peranakan.,"For those who want to learn more about The Overseas Chinese especially the Peranakan from South East Asia, this is one of the good source you can get.Ssituated near Fort Canning Park, this lovely little and peaceful building  had all the exhibit and divided all the topic on several floor. Definitely a source for a researcher"
awLKA,180,Nov 2017,November 2017,40,Learn about Singapore's culture,"Very interesting place to learn about the Peranakan culture of Singapore. The museum features exhibits divided into rooms that cover topics such as marriage, death, food, etc...of the Peranakans. They give guided tours (included in your ticket, check the times) and our Indian guide was quite knowledgeable about the topic and spoke well."
V W,20,Oct 2017,October 2017,50,Very interesting and enjoyable,A lovely little museum in a lovely little street with beautiful old buildings with lovely Footways. The building itself is wonderful inside and out and photo worthy on its own. Very interesting and informative museum. I knew the word Peranakan but now I know really what it means and the history behind this word and culture and afterwards found myself looking at people on the MRT and wondering if they were of Peranakan heritage. Make sure you pick up a paper copy of the Family Treasure wheel with which you have to find embossing stamps hidden in corners of the museum. A lot of fun too. And a little healthy competition between myself and my 18 year old son. Throughly enjoyed this museum. Pair it with a trip to Philatelic museum close by for a fun and interesting morning.
palsd,60,Oct 2017,November 2016,50,Visiting History,If you wish to learn about the Peranakan life and customs then this is the place to be. It gives you an interesting glimpse into the past of the Peranakan people.
wayayeman2014,19,Oct 2017,October 2017,30,A pleasant enough museum,"The focus on cultural identity, and customs, furniture, porcelain, wedding traditions, was very well set out. Good air conditioning made the ambiance most pleasant our guide was very knowledgeable and provided us with an amazing amount of detail, sadly though I could have done with less the tour seemed to go on for ever with nowhere to sit and rest, small musuem 3 hour tour, it's OK (just)"
Jane C,27,Oct 2017,October 2017,50,A wonderful museum with many colourful articles from the Peranakan culture,I had previously visited a Peranakan house in Malaca so I was very interested to see more items and I wasn't disappointed.  This museum is very well laid out across 3 floors - but I took advantage of a free guided tour that was just beginning as I arrived.  Our volunteer guide pointed out the best exhibits in the museum and gave us lots of background to the culture
Danny K,564,Oct 2017,October 2017,50,Wonderful walk down memory lane !,"This beautiful museum is housed in a 3-storey building in Armenian Street in Singapore and the interior is even more fascinating with a very wide range of exhibits and artefacts of the Peranakan or Baba Nyonya community from the Straits Settlements of Malaya and Singapore. Many exhibits have been donated by the Peranakan community leaders or members from Malacca, Penang and not forgetting Singapore itself.<br/><br/>On display were many interesting items which have been very well maintained and preserved over hundreds of years, things like silver dinnerware, antique crockery &amp; utensils dating back to the Ming &amp; Ching dynasties in China, mother-of-pearl laden furniture, heavy bedroom and matrimonial sets, ceremonial attires &amp; the womenfolk's dressing accessories, photographs and many other fascinating exhibits. The exhibits and artefacts are spread over 3 floors accessible by staircases and also an elevator at the back part of the building.<br/><br/>I was made to understand that this museum is being run by the government and an entrance fee of $10 is charged per adult. It is an interesting stopover for any visitor to Singapore and you could easily spend an hour or two to browse through the numerous items and intricacies found there. Although the visitors are constantly being watched by security personnel everywhere all the time, photography is still allowed. There is also a public car park just next to this building."
ABSViews,104,Oct 2017,August 2017,40,A glimpse into peranakan life,"A former school, this quaint museum offers the visitor a glimpse into the life of peranakans, and more importantly, who they are. I enjoyed the guided walking tour as it provided better insights than if I had walked through on my own."
Myselfandhim,23,Oct 2017,October 2017,50,A gem of a museum,"This museum, although small, kept us fascinated for nearly two hours.  It links the culture of Peranakan culture today back through the 20th century and beyond to its origins. Very well thought out and executed!, videos on the second floor were informative."
Anita B,104,Oct 2017,October 2017,50,Wonderful museum with real life exhibits,"Loved our visit to this museum. Our local docent brought the exhibits to life through her stories. Excellent artifacts from this time period &amp; after reading in books, it was fascinating to see daily life in their clothing, furnishings, traditions around weddings &amp; death.  Thank you for this wonderful educational experience."
Easane,13,Oct 2017,September 2017,50,Fascinating!,Beautiful restored heritage building with excellent artifacts and AV displays. I learned a lot about Pernakan culture. Really recommended.
Taitti H,127,Oct 2017,October 2017,40,"Small and cosy, beautiful dinnerware and home items","This is a small and nice place. They have some truly beautiful dinnerware on the top floor. The signs and items are nicely on display, informative but the size of the place is manageable within a 1-2 hour visit. The building itself is perfect - a traditional shophouse setting in the heart of Singapore. I started from the top floor (I was feeling lazy and did not want to walk the stairs so I took the lift up and walked down). Staff at the front counter were very friendly and helpful, and they also have some tours ( I missed the tour start time and did not want to wait). Worth a visit if you are interested in Singaporean culture and traditions."
Ruth B,131,Oct 2017,July 2017,50,An interesting insight,"In ancient times, travellers from Southeast Asia came to the Singapore area to trade and many stayed and married local women.   This museum documents the life of these early people, called the Peranakans.   There are several galleries covering the origins of the Peranakans, their lifestyle including language and fashion, religion, food, weddings and public life, death customs.   A fascinating place, including beautiful fine beadwork.   Admittance was very reasonable and the staff were pleasant and helpful.  I could've spent a lot longer here, but unfortunately, the Singaporean heat and humidity was affecting me on this particular day and we had to leave before I collapsed!    I will go back for another visit next time I'm in Singapore.<br/><br/>It is possible to book a guided tour or just wander around by yourself...there is plenty of signage to inform the visitor."
MrNicTan,346,Oct 2017,October 2017,50,Interesting place,The layout of the museum is nice with theme that includes wedding. The collection is good and you can spend up to 2-3hrs walking around and reading up on many of the displays.
Bali-Melali,33,Sep 2017,October 2016,40,An insight,"It's a wonderful museum. Located near the city centre, the place is a three-storey building, with different sections in each storey to tell us an insight about Peranakan and more. It's one of the unique places in Singapore that visitors have to visit."
Weng Chun W,22,Sep 2017,July 2017,50,An insight to a culture unique to this part of the world. ,Have visited this museum a number of times but each visit is still as interesting as the first.  It is well organised and easy to do. Even if you are not into museums you will enjoy this one. The Peranakan culture is well explained through the exhibits. There are excellent pieces of Nyonya embroidery and fine beadwork.  Wedding and daily use Jewellery are also on display.  Do join a guided tour of the museum. The guides here are excellent in their lively presentation and knowledgeable.
aflame_SG,203,Sep 2017,September 2017,50,A great museum visit with helpful guide,"If you are visiting the museum, please follow the guided tour. So much more stories and extra information.<br/><br/>Kids gets to complete their quest sheet, definitely fun. Great place to spend the evening."
Antonia V,12,Aug 2017,March 2017,50,The place to go in you want to learn about Singapore's past,This is such a wonderful museum. It gives so much information on the Singapore culture and how it was influenced by other cultures coming to Singapore to trade. The museum has a large collection of artifacts. I would recommend having a guide. Without a guide a lot of the information and the insides will be lost.
liaagatha,14,Aug 2017,May 2017,40,Creepy-ish,"I visited this museum at 6PM cause by then they have discounted ticket. I would be lying if I said the place itself emitted creepy aura. I was scared the most by a painting of a woman in the top floor.<br/><br/>The horror aside, the museum itself was organized really well. The directions of the rooms exhibitions were informative. There were some information tablets all around the museum to guide you around."
EaglevisionLowe,278,Aug 2017,February 2017,50,Visit ,"This museum is housed in a historic and beautiful building whose facade is lit at night recently to celebrate Singapore Night Festival. Entry is by ticket. It houses the Straits born Chinese  or Peranakan's collection of cultural relics of a bygone era . Beautiful clothes, jewellery,furniture and household items that are priceless and unique to this part of the world"

Carolann T,170,Aug 2017,August 2017,40,A look back in time,"The Paranakan Museum is small but full of fascinating stories and exhibits detailing the beginnings of this old culture - the result of blending one race with another, many times over.  Three floors of rooms given over to aspects such as language, weddings and food paint a harmonious and gentle picture."
meg57,33,Aug 2017,July 2017,50,Great Tour,"My husband &amp; I recently did the Singapore Heritage Tour which we booked through Viator. $63 ea.  and lasted 3 hrs.  Fortunately for us we were the only 2 on the tour this day so we had a very personal experience.  Mr. Foo our guide conducted a very interesting tour and explained in great detail all the different traditions of the Chinese Peranakan people. First stop was the Spice Gardens where we were introduced to many familiar and unfamiliar spices.  Never seen nutmeg growing before and it looked like an apricot fruit on a small tree.  Then a drive through the wealthier neighbourhoods occupied by the Chinese Peranakan businessmen and their families.  some lovely homes to be seen.  Then on to a shop/house selling many delicacies with a wonderful display upstairs of clothes, furniture and porcelain.  Followed by a tasting of three of the Nonya foods.  A dumpling made of sticky rice with pork filling and spices wrapped in pandana leaves, grilled makeral wrapped in leaves and a lovely layered rice cake. Very delicious.<br/><br/>On the drive to the Peranakan Museum we pass through a lovely neighbourhood with old styled brightly painted houses.  very pretty.  The museum has a wonderful display of the culture of the Peranakan people, beautiful clothes, jewellery, ceramics, furniture, etc.   This tour is a very worthwhile tour for anyone interested in learning about other cultures."
A R H,805,Aug 2017,August 2017,40,Extremely well done.,"The Peranakan culture is unique to Singapore &amp; Malaysia, but I didn't realise that it was split into two different ethnic groups - Chinese and Indian - until I visited the museum.  Apart from some fabulous exhibits it shows what a large part the Paranakan culture played in the development of Singapore and how forward they were in starting schools and fostering the arts.  Well worth a visit, plus there are restaurants along Armenian St where you can taste nyonya cuisine, which will give you a real feel for the Paranakan way of life."
shinraemonsam,"1,076",Aug 2017,April 2017,30,But I still can't define Peranakan to you...,"Great building, lovely guides, pleasant exhibition, right price... but what is Peranakan?<br/><br/>Wife still doesn't know either. <br/><br/>I'm going with this: the first groups of people to live in the area after the indigenous Malays. <br/><br/>That said, I wouldn't bet the house on it. They do have a way with their needlework though."
SingaporeBms,280,Jul 2017,July 2017,50,Great way to connect with Singapore history,"This lovely museum provide a wonderful overview of an important part of Singapore history, culture and ethnicity.  The exhibits are comprehensive without being overwhelming with information.  This is a museum that can be enjoyed by all ages. <br/> On the 2nd Sunday of the month admission is free."
V3488GFpeterl,37,Jul 2017,July 2017,40,Enjoyable Memories,"The history of the Peranakan Museum started when the existing Chinese school was converted to a museum. It showed-case how the locals lived during the olden eines beförderten Singapore was fully developed and under colonial rule. <br/><br/>The museum has many items that depict the cultural heritage of the different ethic people and how trade and traditions were once the center of these people.<br/><br/>It shows how tradition and cultural influence society at large with this unique melting pot of culture. Food therefore stood out to be different and people especially the Chinese Peranakan were deep in their beliefs. You will be able to see these from the way they are dressed and how they live, from wedding to funeral. There are exhibits on their unqiue jewelry too."
Winstonthedog,613,Jul 2017,July 2017,40,Well worth a visit if you're into history,I loved this museum which wasn't overwhelming and told a great story of the Peranakan  Malaysians.  Lots of great exhibits in a traditional museum setting.
Boranin,31,Jul 2017,August 2016,50,Special memories....,it was a special memories I would never forget. The museum is a great to explore and know about Singapore culture. I still keep some items i bought from there.
27jennyk,16,Jul 2017,June 2017,50,Special Place,"This museum was so enjoyable. Informative and a very good insight into the life and development. By far, for me, was the absolute awe in  the stitching and beading. The workmanship on the clothing was incredible; so beautiful and clever. This has to be on top of the visiting list."
Mellen,42,Jul 2017,July 2017,40,Fascinating,"I thoroughly enjoyed this museum. We joined the guided tour, which was enthusiastically delivered by our guide, but not too informative that it become boring (as tours sometimes are).  The museum gave an insight to how the Singapore people developed as that have. Very interesting."
Wendy H,369,Jul 2017,June 2017,40,a quiet place,"The museum provides examples of the Pernakan culture the contribution it has made to the development of Singapore.  Housed in a heritage building not from the Singapore National Museum and fort Canning Park it can readily form a part of a full day exploration in the area.   <br/>Features are biographies on the Peranakan people and their individual contributions to Singapore's development as well as quotes from locals on what being Peranakan means to them.<br/>Photography is not allowed inside the museum.  In some ways this is a shame because the clothing, furniture and ceramics are memories I would like to carry with me for a long time.<br/>Possibly more a place for the local history buffs and not so much for younger children,<br/>Artwork outside the building and in the adjoining alley are well worth a look even if you don't decide to go inside,  There is a small entrance fee,  Worth a visit."
Max B,70,Jul 2017,December 2016,40,A little jewel,Peranakan culture is a difficult concept for a foreigner to get one's head around but this delightful small museum does it well. It is both didactic and pleasing in an aesthetic sense.
han_ching,758,Jun 2017,June 2017,50,Very good insight into the Peranakan world,Very organized and detailed museum - you can get plenty of information on peranakan and the displays were also very good. <br/><br/>You can go by MRT - get down city hall station and walk for about 5-10 minutes. <br/><br/>They have guided tours at 3pm. You need a good 2 hours at least to appreciate the displays in detail (i.e. To read all the explanation re the displays).<br/><br/>Singaporeans and PR holders get in for free. Senior citizens = SGD3 while other tourists = SGD6
Christopher E,324,Jun 2017,May 2017,50,Brilliant!,As an introduction to the various different cultures which make up Singaporean society this museum is absolutely fabulous. We took a guided tour which was very interesting indeed and explained the evolution of the Peranakan culture very well indeed.
KMeowington,67,Jun 2017,April 2017,40,Beautiful culture,"The museum is well kept, clean. Has little bits and pieces here and there that makes you feel like you're in a Peranakan home! The displays and information are accurate, very well done and informative. Will definitely come again with friends!"
Rachael W,25,Jun 2017,June 2017,50,Make sure to visit this gem!,Who are the people from this part of the world? That is the question that this museum will answer for you. We stumbled into this destination to escape the heat but we were very impressed by the dynamic and effective methods used to introduce visitors to the culture. A must-visit for anyone wanting to truly appreciate Singapore in all her uniqueness.
zigsterGoldCoast,57,Jun 2017,June 2017,40,Singapore heritage,"This is an interesting place to visit to help understand the history of the melting pot of races who make up Singapore. The museum is set in very well maintained old colonial building that was once a school. It uses 9 small galleries that each display the artefacts of an aspect of 19th &amp; 20th century life in Singapore. These include food, weddings and funerals. The building itself is set on the edge of Fort Canning Park so these two places can be visited together. A good excursion for history buffs."
Wandering Traveler,"2,701",Jun 2017,June 2017,40,Great hertiage info,If your into the hertiage of the culture and weddings then you will like. I was totally not interested in anything that has to do with weddings.
Sony S,331,Jun 2017,June 2017,30,The multimedia is not working anymore,"I have been to the Peranakan Museum about two years ago.<br/><br/>The last time I was there, the multimedia was working great.<br/><br/>I experienced the LED screens with the actors speaking in Malay at the Wedding Ceremony section.<br/><br/>I also heard the mourning family crying outloud at the Passing Away section etc.<br/><br/>Now, it's all very quiet."
Inokashira,65,Jun 2017,June 2017,50,Great for families ,"This little gem offers a glimpse into the lives of the Straits Chinese aka Pernakans who are the descendants of Chinese or Indian migrants who married local women. They evolved a fascinating culture and language unique to Singapore. There are 2 English language tours at 11 and 2 and excellent guides. The museum is arranged in themed rooms such as weddings, religion, fashion, and food. What's cool for the little ones are the displays where you can touch the artefacts and also you get a special paper where you can collect stamps as you go round the museum. Also it's not too big so the main rooms can even covered in an hour if you have kids. There's a great display of the famous Pernakan beaded needlework. Gift shop next door. And True Blue restaurant is also next door if you want a taste of the fabulous Pernakan cuisine which combines Indian, Chinese and Malay flavours. Food and culture in a central location in Armenian St. make for a fun excursion."

It included Singapore , malacca and Penang.<br/>Colourful dresses , jewellery and porcelain tableware mark the priceless collections of that era. <br/>The museum has priceless historic items that was part and parcel of the Singaporean identity."
AsianGM,683,May 2017,May 2017,40,Delightful history lesson,"Lived in Singapore over 10 years before I chanced upon this gem behind Stamford house.  Fascinating hour understanding one of Singapore's most unique and strongest cultures.<br/><br/>Gorgeous 3 storey museum housed in an old school, I found the Peranakan wedding exhibits the most fascinating.  Only gripe, the souvenier shop on ground floor was rather cheesy with fridge magnets etc. Disapppointed not to find more upmarket examples of the fine beadwork and fabrics.<br/><br/>Pity when I registered on entry that they didn't pass out the sheet for collecting embossed stamps which were lovely.  Do ask if visiting."
DQ Ng,3,May 2017,October 2016,50,Fun and exciting museum ,This museum is amazing. It teaches so many things i didn't know about Peranakan. Fun side about this museum is there will be guided tour. Me and my partner enjoy going there once in a while as there are new exhibition every time. Good choice to go there!
Nick D,"1,248",May 2017,March 2017,50,Teach us,"museums are there, in part at least, to teach us something; to show us what has happened, to let us learn.  The Peranakan Museum does that.  It is a very impressive collection of materials, photos, artifacts, and memories of the ""mixed"" cultures of Singapore.  We had a guide to ourselves for over an hour (thank you Julie) and then we spent another 3 hours going through the three floors of exhibits.  We didn't know anything about the Peranakan culture but we learned some on our visit."
Deb4707,58,May 2017,June 2016,50,A Little Gem!,"Often overlooked, this little gem of a museum gives visitors an insightful understanding of Peranakan culture. The building itself is gorgeous and the exhibits are more than worth a visit. There is even stuff to entertain the kids -- a thoughtful touch for such a small museum. Well worth your time!"
BillTaylor2014,52,May 2017,April 2017,50,An interesting visit,A well set out museum giving a real insight into Asian culture. Some of the displays were breath taking.
LynC270,76,May 2017,April 2017,50,a quick lesson on this unique Asian culture,"Impressive display on the beadwork of table covers, smaller pieces and even shoes! Elaborate settings of Peranakan homes which foreigners would never get to see otherwise. Join a tour to get greater insights into the designs."
951jjp,48,Apr 2017,September 2016,30,Peranakan,A place to get to know about the Peranakan heritage. Many displays there are nostalgic memories from the past
Lilium D,7,Apr 2017,April 2017,40,To learn about Peranakan culture,"This museum is situated in one of the monuments of Singapore. It used to be a school. In this museum, you will learn who are the Peranakans and how they used to live. I personally like their needlework and embroidery. Currently on exhibit is the ""Nyonya Needlework: Embroidery and Beadwork in the Peranakan World"". It is a wonderful exhibition  displaying the art of nyonya needlework. Some artifacts includes the fusion of western influences. It is be very interesting to see and admire their delicate work. There are free guided tours. Do attend if you have the time."
murali8121,794,Apr 2017,April 2017,40,Peranakan museum Singapore ,Took a guided tour at 11:00 which gave us a very good insight to the history of singapore with regard to the life here before and after the world war. The life of a Nyonya- the girl in the family- is showcased in detail. The embroidery and bead work is also worth looking at. There is an entry charge with a discount for senior citizen but guided tour is free and part of voluntary service. Look to spend around two hours
viviennedBangalore,179,Apr 2017,March 2017,40,A special place. A must see .,"A delightful museum that gives visitors an insight into a fast disappearing way of life. Child friendly and entertaining. Although brochures are available, I suggest you join a conducted tour for the best experience. Plan to spend a leisurely hour followed by a walk in the spice garden nearby."
Kat T,830,Apr 2017,April 2017,50,museum out of a converted Chinese school building ,"If you like heritage architecture conservation, then the building is interesting in itself. Apparently, it used to be a school, and the renovation (including sealing off for air-conditioning and modernising the lighting) looked pretty comfortable. <br/><br/>The museum pieces &amp; curating were pretty good -- covered different facets of the life (marriage, funerals, ancestor worship, religion, food, needlework, furniture) but without being having too many pieces on display -- the lighting &amp; spacing of the pieces were pretty good too, but the upper floor of the annex part of the needlework might have benefitted from a bit more lights.<br/><br/>Set aside at least 60 minutes for the exhibits, and maybe more if you want to snoop around the building. <br/><br/>Descriptions (personally didn't leave enough time to join the guided tour) were relatively detailed &amp; nuanced. Could have been interesting to see information on how some of the nonyaware were made -- in particular how the colouring was achieved. If readers want to go deep about it, the Museum of Asian Civilisations down the quay had a ceramic exhibit showcasing mainland Chinese earthenware &amp; stoneware pieces which did not have the raw materials to give the finished ceramic pieces, as here, the kind of glaze and background colours which 19th century and early 20th century nonyaware had. Notes about how these materials were produced (the industrial engineering behind it, so to speak) would have given yet another separate dimension to appreciate the spread of the artisanal &amp; industrial techniques, the fashions &amp; patterns, the clan/lineage networks between the mainland and SE Asia, etc."
Collin B,51,Apr 2017,February 2017,50,Worth a visit,"This museum is in an old school, a very nice old building. There was an exhibition of Peranakan needle work, which was very interesting. This museum would be good if you are interested in social history, or in art / furniture. There is a very interesting reconstruction of a nyonya kitchen &amp; dining room. Fair warning: part of the exhibition goes off on a tangent about local political notaries / families, not really interesting. Overall this was well worth a visit."
Maplehawk,404,Apr 2017,March 2017,40,A unique piece of local history,We very much enjoyed learning about the local community as reflected in the blended cultures of the various local and immigrant communities.  <br/><br/>This small museum is well organized and narrated. The building itself is a bonus piece of history.  A very easy walk from the National Museum.
sandyf1,45,Apr 2017,March 2017,40,Great experience,"Spent a couple of hours here, 4 Adults and 2 kids and all enjoyed it. Well worth a visit if you have some spare time."
Arielleeeee_c,55,Apr 2017,April 2017,50,Very interesting,"Interesting place for you discover more about the Peranakan group. You get to see the bed they used in the past, the things in the Baba and Nonya's house in the past and also get to try on some of the clothes. The only thing is that it takes some walking from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station."
Xin27,27,Apr 2017,April 2017,50,"Lovely museum,  an eye opener","A must visit when you visit Singapore. Check the tour timings and make sure you join a guided tour. You will be lucky if you get Thomas, who is knowledgeable and passionate. We learnt alot from him."
556bharris,165,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Tremendous museum.,"It is easy to spend a couple of hours in this fine old building with its interesting displays about the Straits Chinese and their interactions with Malay and Indian peoples and the hybrid cultures that developed as a result. Pick up the free Jubilee walk booklet and check out the other interesting sites on the walk. Also, pop into the nearby National Heritage Board and pick up their amazing free booklets on Little India, Kampong Glam, and a number of other parts of singapore."
Frank C,53,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Very interesting place,"The peranakan culture is unknown to most of us outside of Singapore, but is fascinating to learn about.  The museum is excellent and gives you a great overview of how the peranakan culture evolved and influences Singapore to this day."
flapflap,160,Mar 2017,March 2017,40,Lovely museum,"This former school houses a lovely collection of treasures such as wedding wear, furniture and kitchenware. A special display of elaborate embroidery was also shown when we visited. Cute stamping collection available for the young and young at heart. $10 entry for non-Singapore citizens."
Frank S,305,Mar 2017,September 2016,50,Great Museum,"Well put together museum! The Peranakan Museum celebrates the lives of Peranakans, or Chinese immigrants to the Malay Peninsula (including Singapore). You get to hear their stories, getting a closer glimpse of their lives after they chose to immigrate."
Leslie M,15,Mar 2017,April 2016,50,Loved it.,"If you're a history buff, this is the place to go.  You find out about the original people in the Singapore area, the beautiful bead work they did, customs, traditions, etc. Once you have visited here, you will want to see some of the homes. Also, notice some of the artwork in the buildings."
geographyguy_11,510,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Unexpected delight,"The Peranakan Museum is located a few streets away from the busy city centre but houses a rich collection of beautiful and fascinating artifacts that explain the unique culture of the Straits-born Chinese people of Singapore. The objects on show are quite exquisite, from beading to clothing to furniture. The ceremonies important to this culture are explained in detail and their unusual beliefs highlighted. I left having learnt a great deal about the customs and lifestyles of the Peranakans and was surprised how enjoyable I found looking at clothes and household items. Well worth making a trip to see this genuine look at ""local"" life."
Chris Q,46,Mar 2017,March 2017,40,Very pleasant museum unique insights,"Throughly enjoyed the visit , clean modern and with a/c , lovely building with great pieces to view , nice shop to visit after too . Staff very helpful too ."
Steve W,9,Mar 2017,April 2016,50,Very good displays of Peranakan culture.,"My wife is from a Peranakan family, and this was a very informative place for me to visit. Very heritage oriented, and no guides pushing you to move along."
Vera V,116,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Great introduction to the Peranakan culture,"This is not a big museum but they offer lots of insight into the local Peranakan culture. The permanent exhibitions feature interesting items and the thematic layout is easy to explore. Having some corners to listen to real Peranakan telling their stories, some pieces are ""for touch and feel"".. these interactive showcases are really great! I also like the Peranakan restaurant just next door. The size of the museum also means one is not overwhelmed by the exhibitions. A few hours into the history and culture, moves on to sample the delicious food at the restaurant, and one can then continue to the next spot which could be the Fort Canning Park nearby or shopping at Dhoby Ghaut / Orchard or Raffles City area a few bus stops away. For those who are into history, there's also the National Museum of Singapore nearby."
Passportalwaysready,138,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Always a delight,"I have been to the Peranakan Museum several times over the years and appreciate the atmosphere, the spacious galleries and the fascinating stories shared there.  This time I went for a temporary nonya beading exhibit which was well curated and very interesting and beautiful."

ponnapa2016,98,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Exceptionally curated exhibition of Peranakan culture,"We visited this museum after viewing another exquisite exhibition at The National Gallery - SIAPA NAMA KAMU? ART IN SINGAPORE SINCE THE 19TH CENTURY. Both were outstanding and a brilliant effort at showcasing an unique Peranakan culture that makes Singapore what it is today. There is a lot that other nations can learn from these most interesting, passionate and revealing exhibitions as the world evolves into a global community and yet emphasises the need to preserve smaller cultures."
cadamsesq,144,Mar 2017,March 2017,50,Great exhibit for a unique people,"This small museum chronicles the Peranakan peoples of Singapore ... a ""creole"" mixture of different asian cultures: Indian, Malaysian, Indonesian, and Chinese, all rolled up into one people.  The exhibit here made it easy and interesting to understand the lives of these people who successfully blended diverse cultures into one interesting mix."
Bitte_von,205,Mar 2017,February 2017,40,A very interesting culture,"Do not miss out on this interesting museum -it describes a culture most foreigners are not familiar with. Very charming and family friendly, take time to visit all the floors"
John D,331,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,Great presentation ,Allow plenty of time to visit this lovely museum and if possible join a free guided tour which run regularly. If you want to understand part of the heart of Singapore and it's Peranakan culture this is the place to come. Entry is at a very reasonable price and the exhibits are very clearly described
Rahneida,45,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,Butterfly's day out,We had a lovely time our tour guide was fun and informative. I learned a lot about the culture and where they came from.
IQQ,198,Feb 2017,February 2017,40,Ok if combined with visit to national museum,This is a small museum in a beautiful building. I would recommend taking guided visit to appreciate better- otherwise nothing really special. Only couple of blocks from the fantastic national museum so good use of time. Otherwise it can be skipped.
Ling H,28,Feb 2017,February 2017,40,A culturally interesting museum in Singapore,"This museum is definitely worth a visit. The guided tour by one of the staff is highly recommended. The history and culture of this mixed ethnic group is traced back to the Chinese and Indian traders who married the local women in this region. The exhibits are well presented and documented. The various galleries are clean and accessible. My only suggestion is that some of the rooms' lighting be a bit brighter. It was hard for me to read the small print on the plaques. Otherwise, this is an excellent museum for those interested in the Peranakan lifestyle, custom and culture. <br/>Final word - a coffee shop or cafe serving Peranakan cakes and desserts would be well received. The gift shop is a bit cramp and the souvenirs pricey."
Peter K,98,Feb 2017,January 2017,30,Learn more about Singapore Culture and People,"On your next trip to Singapore you should make some time to visit this Museum wich is kind of the beaten track.

Their lives were very colorful with the blend of several cultures, social fabrics and other interesting paraphernalia that marked out their existence in Singapore. A must visit while you are there. The souvenir shop is just next door but I found that incredibly pricey ."

Sebastian3962,184,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,Small cultural museum,A real treat to experience some of the culture of Singapore. Right now have an exhibit of Nyonya Needlework which is an exhibit of embroidery and beadwork of the Persnskian Chinese culture. The beadwork and embroideries are exquisite. The entire museum shows Peranakian culture and customs. Very well done and interesting. A must visit when in Singapore.

Heidi S,49,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,Beautifully presented introduction to Peranakan culture,"This museum was well worth the visit.  It flows really nicely with a good intro video on ground floor setting the stage for the displays in the galleries above.  The special exhibit that I saw on embroidery and beadwork was truly amazing.  Visiting this museum really deepened my understanding of Singapore's culture - past, present and future."
TheEverydayTourist,26,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,Beautifully staged primer on Peranakan culture.,"The museum contains three levels that give you an in depth look at what life was like for the Peranakans in Singapore. <br/><br/>The first level is the story of their origins - how they ended up in Singapore from different parts of China and India. It also gives you a broad view of what life was like for them - the kinds of elaborate wedding gifts that they received, their jewellery, their intricately beaded slippers. Another highlight is the giant portraits of faces of different Peranakans and their quotes on what it means for them to identify with their ethnicity.<br/><br/>The second level is devoted to their wedding ceremony - including the kinds of costumes that they wear during this 12-day celebration, their wedding crowns and jewelry, information on their peculiar superstitions (apparently a boy had to roll around in their bed before the couple's wedding night to ensure that they will get a son), their elaborately carved wedding bed and more.<br/><br/>The third level is about their daily life, religion, and mourning practices where you'll see a typical Peranakan kitchen, the gods that they worshipped (a unique mixture of Chinese and Indian gods and ancestor worship) on their beautifully carved altars, and an example of a coffin bed and what they wore during the entire mourning process (including a sack cloth at the end of the mourning period).<br/><br/>There are so many beautiful things inside this museum - hopefully, you'll learn to appreciate their gaudy, elaborate, extravagantly colourful aesthetic sensibility which comes out in their many multi-coloured and multi-carved jewelry, spittoons, furniture and other beautiful pieces."
lawgoddess1960,130,Feb 2017,February 2017,50,"Great museum, wait for the tour","This museum is beautifully arranged and is well worth the visit. I luckily decided to wait for the lovely docent to bring around a tour and her insights and knowledge into the history of the Peranakans was fascinating. If I hadn't been on the tour I never would have gotten so much out of the museum. I can't recommend it highly enough. Very small, very manageable. Approx 1 1-2 hrs. There are many beautiful things in the museum but the history of these people is fascinating."

Entrance is only 10SGD for non residents."

Peranakans are a mixed bunch of people, combining a few heritage together into a unique fusion identity of its own and you have to see it to understand what that means.<br/><br/>Interesting and quaint little museum that will try to show you what is it to be a Peranakan in Singapore. Be sure to collect the letterpress stamp while doing the tour of the Museum!"

Marvel over the exquisite bead work, the beautiful and colourful ceramics and get to understand the traditions and way of life of the Peranakan people. The guides are very thorough and worth listening to."
M M,85,Jan 2017,January 2017,50,Good place to get understanding about Chinese history in South Eastern Asia,"Until I visited this museum, I had very rough understanding about Chinese people in this region. However, after the visit, it was eye-opening of how Peranakan people went through in the past years. Worth to visit."

pleneuf,69,Jan 2017,November 2016,50,Wonderful little museum,"I really enjoyed the free guided tour at 11 am. The museum highlights the Peranakan culture in Singapore. The building is old and just next to the Armenian Church. Easy to reach by public transport. The stories and artefacts that the guide shared with us, made it a highlight and we will certainly come back"
SingaporeGirl,527,Jan 2017,November 2016,40,Malay &amp; Chinese = Peranakan!,"Here's where you discover multi-cultural Singapore's sub-culture of mixed Malay-Chinese families who are known by the name Peranakan. This museum is like visiting a Peranakan home with rooms full of furniture, clothing, accessories and the odds 'n ends that made a family Peranakan. Take advantage of the free tours (2 or 3 every day of the week) as the guides really help explain what you're looking at. There's also a small gift shop with some really unusual local arts &amp; crafts that make terrific souvenirs (better than statues of the merlion). Only downside is there doesn't seem to be any local casual eatery nearby where you can get a coffee or cold drink although there's an (expensive) Peranakan restaurant and French restaurant on the same block that cater to more upscale visitors. Walking distance from the National Museum and Asian Civilisations Museum so a perfect rainy day museum itinerary."

Denis D,43,Dec 2016,December 2016,40,Mid Morning Stroll,"We found this little museum at the rear of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Singapore. Not knowing anything about the Peranakans, we decided to take a look in and found a very interesting little museum set on three floors. The museum explains the origins of the Peranakan people in the area and shows many aspects of their culture and traditions such as weddings, food, death and afterlife and their exquisite needlework. A very interesting find."
Jonathan L,14,Dec 2016,December 2016,50,A truly interesting experience,The design of this museum is excellent with a truly vintage look. I enjoyed all the galleries of the museum and particularly like the one on weddings. The Peranakan culture is extremely interesting  with such a rich blend of various cultures. Would definitely return again for more :)

0591TimS,739,Dec 2016,December 2016,30,"Good for people interested in fabrics, clothing design and regional cultural history","We grabbed a couple of hours in this museum. The lower floor historical and mixed cultural background displays were very interesting. The upper floor displays included a lot of embroidery and beadwork by “Nyonyas”; Peranakan women. The intricate nature of these designs serves to emphasize how our view of time priorities has changed so radically. Displays of home life for these cultural traditions also remind us of how we’ve moved away to our current fast paced lives and perhaps have lost something in the process. The impression this museum gives is that the mixed cultural development of the 19th and early 20th centuries was a functional melting pot, nonetheless dominated by Chinese influences. It would be nice to be able to believe this cultural tolerance and happy coexistence of different religions and cultures is a strong foundation for a multicultural Singapore. I suspect that reality is not (and was never) quite so accepting."

allspice502016,935,Nov 2016,October 2016,40,Peranakan’s Rich Culture,"Peranakan Chinese or Straits-born Chinese are the descendants of Chinese immigrants (from the 15th &amp; 16th centuries) who came to the Malay Archipelago. They adopted the term ""Peranakan"" to distinguish themselves from the new immigrants. The male descendants were called Babas and female descendants Nyonyas. Some of the Nyonyas still wear their traditional costumes called the Kebaya which is a beautiful, translucent, figure-hugging embroidered blouse worn with a batik sarong.This museum specializes in Peranakan culture and displays a comprehensive understanding of Peranakan traditions, from traditional wedding ceremonies, to displays of traditional needlework and beadwork. The museum is housed in the former Tao Nan Chinese School built in 1912. A small museum but packs in a lot of interesting exhibits."

Housed in a delightful building over three floors, the s slightly tucked away the Peranakan Museum showcases the culture of the Peranakan communities.  The wedding collection is particularly of interest.  The needlework exhibition demonstrates a colour part of the Peranakan culture.  Easy to see why this museum rates so highly by fellow travellers!"
Chris P,308,Nov 2016,October 2016,40,Small but interesting museum,Small and compact museum spread over several floors. The place gives a good insight in to the different Peranakan origins as well as early life in Singapore. IT doesn't take too long to see all the exhibits so worthwhile swinging  by if in the area.
Elisheva2012,11,Oct 2016,October 2016,50,OMG! A new MUST!,"I admit this museum sounded like it was not going to make the to see list. There is too much to do and I am here for a conference. Also, who knows what Perenakans is or are? However, walking from one place to another, I saw it and walked in (no charge!!!!). The museum focuses on the artisan work of the Peranakans. The term refers to individuals of mixed Chinese and Malay heritage. They do the  most amazing bead and embroidery work. Truly humbling, colorful creative and exquisite. The museum also includes wonderful displays of clothes and furniture. Clothes are placed on dummies with explanations as to the purpose and nature. Furniture is arranged by type and purpose of room. For example, there is an amazing table set in beautiful local china. There are a set of figures representing a wedding march. There are also ""touchy-feely"" boxes where you can feel how certain fabrics or wood carvings feel.  Videos with interviews of current artisans of bead work are integrated in the exhibits. etc. Truly a wonderful experience and child friendly as  well. I did not see elevators, so watch out for the stairs."
Erica C,47,Oct 2016,October 2016,30,Interesting place to know more about Malaysian Chinese,"I was introduced by Tourisum centre at Chinatown. I walked from Chinatown Backpacker. According to Google map, it was not far away around 20 mins.  At last I used 35 mins, may be walking slow. The museum is free if charge. 3 storeys high elegance building. I like this type if building much. Exhibition room were great, full of collection, handmade sewing, household wares. If you are interested to know more about the life of Malaysian Chinese, you should come. They have a lot of things for you to see and touch."

This is a small museum, however it is rich with valuable things.

And also displays of delicate elaborate handicrafts of Straight Chinese ladies."
tot2trish,81,Oct 2016,April 2016,40,Informative insight into indigenous culture,"Peranakans are native-born people of mixed local and foreign ancestry. Peranakan culture is described as a blend of two cultures where the people are ethnic Chinese but culture and language are predominantly Malay-influenced.  The Peranakan Museum is worthwhile to visit, if one wishes to learn about the local people who make up a good proportion of Singapore.  There were interactive exhibits when I was there which involved locating a dozen different symbols (such as dragon, phoenix, floral designs, etc.) matched to exhibits, then embossing the symbol on a color wheel on paper provided by the museum docents.  It was fun as well as educational.  Learning about famous Peranakans and seeing some of their handiwork was interesting.  The museum is three stories, but there's an elevator (or lift) available for those with mobility issues or young children in strollers."

Anna R,571,Oct 2016,September 2016,40,Great insight into Peranakan culture,"The Peranakan Museum is a must for tourists who want to learn more about the history and culture of Singapore. <br/>To make the most of the museum, make sure you take a free guided tour (available at least twice a day at 11 am and 2 pm, and some days also at 12.30). The tours are run by volunteers of Peranakan background and take about 1 hour. <br/>Our guide was excellent: knowledgeable, entertaining and a great story teller. Also, take a look at the tiny gift shop near the entrance, selling genuine Peranakan crafts and souvenirs: the shop it is so small I nearly missed it...<br/>And if you are interested in crafts, the incredibly intricate Peranakan beadwork has to be seen to be believed."
HesterCalkhoven,19,Oct 2016,May 2016,50,My favourite museum in Singapore,"A small but very authentic museum in Singapore. It will give you, within half an hour to an hour, a very good impression on how Singapore came to be."
Jon S,65,Oct 2016,October 2016,20,Very disappointed,"Probably not the fault of the museum, but due to extensive renovations, there were virtually no exhibits. Better to close than give high expectations, only to led the viewer down."

Rod Valenta,85,Sep 2016,September 2016,40,Intricate Needlework,"Visiting this museum was a highlight of my visit to Singapore - luckily I saw an advertisement on the back of a bus that enticed me in!<br/>The building itself is just beautiful, and houses displays of the Peranakan people's culture, art, and every day life objects. I found it fascinating.<br/>There are 9 galleries over three levels covering everything from origins, food &amp; feasting, language &amp; fashion, religion, weddings and public life. There is a lift, but the stairwell is beautiful.<br/>Until the end of March 2017 there is a special exhibition of Nyonya needlework which is the most amazing display of intricate embroidery and beadwork. Some of the works were from the permanent display, while others were on loan, and they were all incredible and well worth seeing. The colours and lustre of the silk threads were beautiful."
Allyjet,69,Sep 2016,November 2015,40,Interesting museum that gives good insight in local culture and Heritage,"Took my parents to see this museum. Was very nice and informative.

Well worth a visit."
Yvonne C,71,Sep 2016,November 2015,40,Great insight into Straits Chinese culture,"Despite being such a small and relatively young country, I applaud Singapore's efforts at building its cultural hubs - and the Peranakan Museum is one of them. Peranakan is a word used to refer to Straits Chinese Singaporeans/Malaysians - essentially Chinese people who have adopted Malay customs through intermarriage or just by culture assimilation (given that this area of Malaya/Indonesia tend to be primarily Javanese/Malay in ethnicity). It's a great way to see how these cultures have assimilated and for tourists to understand that race can be a fluid concept for us here in this part of the world. Highly recommended."
smiley98,37,Sep 2016,September 2016,50,A little gem in Singapore,This museum is a little gem.   I took part in a small guided tour which was very interesting and informative.

A great couples of hours spent in the Museum Highly recommended
Stephanie N,185,Sep 2016,August 2016,40,Very Interesting Full of History,"Fantastic museum full of so much information and history. I really enjoyed learning about their culture and customs. There are about 3 levels showing life, history, needlework, home life, marriage and death. There are interactive sections for kids including craft. For $10 it is excellent value. It is easy to get to via public transport. They have clean bathroom facilities as well. Air conditioning gets a bit cold so bring a jumper."

AugustoMonteverdi,169,Sep 2016,August 2016,30,"Ambitious, but Misses the Mark","The museum made a valiant attempt to define ""peranakan"" in a broad, general, and almost literal term; however, the message seems to shift as you make your way through the galleries.  In the end, I find the original message and definition that were offered when you enter the museum have been undermined completely.<br/><br/>I understand the desire to expand the definition of peranakan to include the different ethnic groups and to present a harmonious and wholesome view of the heritage of Singapore that reflects the cultural make up of today's Singapore.  I suppose that is the purpose of the series of large photographs of peranakan Singaporeans of different ages, most of them credited with a pretentious and/or ambiguous statement about what it means to be peranakan.  It was almost a breath of fresh air when I came to the photograph of a man credited with saying he does not ""feel""  peranakan; he just feels--or something to that effect.<br/><br/>Beyond the first galleries, the exhibits limited their focus completely to the Chinese peranakan, specifically the Hokkien (Fujian) peranakan--probably the predominant peranakan group in Singapore.  While it was interesting to see objects in the exhibit--wedding and funerary objects, clothing, dinner ware--I kept thinking about the central theme presented in the first gallery:  What is a peranakan?   I do not think those objects are what make one a Hokkien peranakan, let alone a general peranakan.  <br/><br/>Ultimately for me, the lack of exploration of the ""why's"" --to use a simple example:  Why did a young Fujianese woman suddenly decide that it was a good idea to wear sarong and kebaya?--makes the experience feel utterly incomplete and superficial."
Helen M,13,Sep 2016,July 2016,50,Wonderful display of Singapore's history,I was lucky enough to catch the Nyonya Needlework exhibition and it was amazing. This intimate museum shows the colourful daily lives of the Peranakan culture.
Coral M,14,Aug 2016,August 2016,50,A Look into Singapore's Interesting Heritage,"We were fortunate to arrive just before 2 pm and joined a tour led by Joan. What a wonderful guide, a forth generation Peranakan who led us through how the original local women formed partnerships with sailors and traders from mainly China and India forming the unique culture called Pernanakan. Over three floors of interesting exhibits. A wonderful experience."
Roseocean,81,Aug 2016,September 2015,50,History at its finest.,"To understand the word Peranakan you need to come see how the two cultures became one.  The traditions both shared were very well married into the people that we now use one word to describe. The dress, furniture, and lifestyle are visible and each has a fantastic explanation of why things are  the way we now see. The beliefs system and values carried the traditions that help us understand the culture. If you love history this is a place for you."

I didn't know much about the subject before but this museum makes it really easy to understand.  It is understated but informative and interesting. <br/><br/>I loved the embroidery exhibition, and also the marriage exhibition.

Pippilotta111,32,Aug 2016,August 2016,50,Beautiful museum,"The museum is housed in a beautiful building inside as well as outside. There was an exhibition of the embroideries of the Peranakan women and I have never seen anything like it. These women were real artists and they paint with beads and silk. The colour combinations are extraordinay and their expertise is amazing. All aspects of their life are represented in the museum like religion, marriage, cooking and furniture. These women had a style of their own and were educated as well and they loved beautiful objects. There is also a good shop next to the museum with lovely books."

roadtrippernineteen,256,Aug 2016,August 2016,50,Gorgeous Museum full of straits history,Ensure you do the tour! It's a lovely museum seeped in history. Walking around without the tour one must read the signs to appreciate the nonya peranakan culture.
Levinia C,34,Aug 2016,August 2016,50,"Beautiful beading and needle work, well worth a visit and easy to get to",Visited this museum for the first time today. Don't know why I've not been before. Like all museums very reasonable entry fee and very cheap for seniors.<br/>If you do come pick u the wheel at the entry desk and you can take impression from presses at many of the exhibits. Life to the top and walk down. Set aside 2 hours. You can rush round in less and send more.
SimoneSMC,77,Aug 2016,July 2016,40,Fascinating museum,"A small cute museum tucked in a small lane called Armenian Street near the Hill Street fire station. I'll recommend that you visit if you're in town for a few days and want to know about the history of the Straits Chinese in the south east Asian region. Prior to the British colony days, Singapore was already an important port of call for international traders including the Chinese. The intermarriage between the indigenous peoples with the Chinese and even Indians (perhaps less represented in SG mainstream media) produced the Straits Chinese and peranakans.<br/><br/>I stayed two hours here in all. The artifacts are not as many as I'd thought would be collected so I'm somewhat disappointed. I think the important facet of peranakan food could have been better displayed and presented. The display for the prominent peranakan VIPs was also awkwardly done up, with information panels all over the place and lacking in pictures. I had to crane my neck to read. If space is a premium the curators could use multi media to tell us a more coherent story. <br/><br/>Nevertheless if you're just looking to while away a hot afternoon and you've visited the bigger museums, this one could still be intriguing."
Samatswindn,42,Jul 2016,July 2016,50,A wonderful cultural experience...,"This museum is not large, but is on 3 floors (with lifts).   It is a presentation of the Peranakan culture, exhibiting antique homewares and the beautiful beadwork of the women; work so delicate that one wonders if it had caused them blindness.  On previous visits I was unaware of this little gem, but am so glad that I found it this time."
Monica K,6,Jul 2016,June 2016,50,Must see to understand the Peranakans,"I love visiting this museum because of the rich mix of antiques. They are all so beautifully crafted with stories behind it. If you are looking for beauty, hereit is."
M Nowell,25,Jul 2016,December 2015,40,Small but Interesting Museum,"We happened upon the Peranakan Museum. As foreigners, it was an introduction to an entirely new culture, which was fascinating. Even though the museum is a bit out-dated in most of its exhibits, it is pleasant to wander through and definitely a great introduction to Peranakan history."
Z K,26,Jul 2016,April 2016,40,Interesting aspect of Singapore history,"This small museum holds some interesting displays showing the history and culture of the Peranakan people - the original settlers who intermarried with the locals in Singapore. They are a diverse population because the settlers came from a range of places, China, India and the ME included. <br/>I would recommend taking the tour which is run by volunteers, to make better sense of the displays. Then I would recommend having a Peranakan meal to complete the experience!"
JulieLimSY,157,Jul 2016,July 2016,40,Good,"It was a well spent one and a half hours for me.  Really interesting exhibits on the life and culture of the Peranakans.  Free admission for Singaporeans and PRs.  <br/><br/>I particularly liked the exhibits on Peranakan weddings, and also the barrister wigs of both Mr and Mrs Lee Kuan Yew that were on display. <br/><br/>I paid $4 for entry to the special exhibition on Peranakan beadwork which was so worth it as that took up about one third of the exhibition in the whole museum.  <br/><br/>A must see for tourists and Singaporeans."

Jason G,51,Jul 2016,April 2016,40,I didn't know what Peranakan meant when I visited.  Now I know!,As a US traveler I knew next to noting about Peranakan culture and history and now have an appreciation for an important part of Singaporean culture.  The exhibits are beautiful and there are a lot of them but I didn't feel like I needed more than an hour or two to follow along on the tour and view the displays.
SingaporeSuzie007,84,Jul 2016,May 2016,30,Small and definitely geared toward adults,"I visited with my husband on a weekday afternoon -  it was my birthday and we came after lunch.  I was glad our boys weren't with us.  They did have some hands-on exhibits for kids, but they were all broken, stolen or missing.  It was mostly cases of things to look at with long explanations on placards.  As an adult, that's what I expect from a 'museum'.  But this is not for kids.<br/><br/>It's a small  museum - especially given that, I've never seen so many security guards.  Not even at the British Museum or the V&amp;A.  It's a bit off-putting to have them follow you around and hover over you.  Everything's in glass cases; it's not like we were going to lift the exhibits.    <br/><br/>Even for adults, it's pretty dry.  I do feel like I have a better understanding of some of the aspects of Peranakan art and life in the early 20th century.  But we spent about an hour and a half there and I didn't feel like I needed much more time.  There's not much interactive and even the descriptions are dull.<br/><br/>I've seen what the creative staff here in Singapore can do at places like the Aquarium - it's clear they hired a staff with a very different approach to create the displays here, and it's sad.  We did not partake of the guided tour as we came late and had limited time.  We did overhear part of it and it did sound like it would brighten the experience and breathe a bit of life into the learning. <br/><br/>The gift shop is ridiculously overpriced.  Stuff there is pricier than the exact same things in Orchard or Tanglin.  The one thing we didn't get to do was eat.  I may return to try some of their authentic Peranakan specialties."
Epiphyte1,75,Jul 2016,July 2016,40,Learn the native culture of Singapore and surrounding area,I was fascinated by the intricate detail that created silkthread and beadwork art. Incredibly beautiful pieces on display from tapestries to beaded shoes. The home exhibit with furnishings of  peranakan families and their traditions is also an excellent display.
Patti B,94,Jul 2016,July 2016,50,Beautiful and well presented,"This museum is small and well laid out.  The pieces on display are stunning, the handwork involved must be seen to do it justice.  You can spend hours in the place or quickly go through, but for folks who appreciate handmade articles of clothing, shoes, purses, bed spreads and beading, it may well take hours.<br/><br/>The little shoppe which sells souvenirs is expensive.  Enjoy."
hannahsholmes,39,Jul 2016,June 2016,30,Needle point,"Pop in here to get out of the heat and cool off.  Cost $10.  There was a needlework display going on.  Interesting for my sister, okay for me as I do not do needlework."
BrotherDragon,170,Jul 2016,July 2016,50,Of millions of minuscule beads and intricate embroidery,"The Peranakan Museum is one of my favourite museums in Singapore though it is comparatively smaller than the other museums here. Reason being it showcases quality stuff of the Peranakan community, which is fast disappearing due to the effects of modernisation.<br/><br/>Just a short word about the Peranakan community for those unfamiliar with this sub-cultural group, who are found mainly in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. I quote from Wikipedia: ""Peranakan Chinese or Straits-born Chinese are the descendants of Chinese immigrants who came to the Malay archipelago including British Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, where they are also referred to as Baba-Nyonya) and Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia; where they're also referred as Kiau-Seng) between the 15th and 17th centuries.<br/><br/>""While the term Peranakan is most commonly used to refer to those of Chinese descent also known as Straits Chinese (named after the Straits Settlements; 土生華人 in Chinese; Tionghoa-Selat or Tionghoa Peranakan in Indonesian; Phuket Baba among Thais in Phuket, Thailand), there are also other, comparatively smaller Peranakan communities, such as Indian Hindu Peranakans (Chitty), Arab/Indian Muslim Peranakans (Jawi Pekan) (Jawi being the Javanised Arabic script, Pekan a colloquial contraction of Peranakan) and Eurasian Peranakans (Kristang = Christians of Portuguese and Asian ancestry). The group has parallels to the Cambodian Hokkien, who are descendants of Hoklo Chinese, and the Pashu of Myanmar, a Burmese word for the Peranakan or Straits Chinese who have settled in Myanmar. They maintained their culture partially despite their native language gradually disappearing a few generations after settlement.""<br/><br/>The Peranakan Museum has very good exhibits of artefacts that give a good representation of what Peranakan life was like during its heyday - from the kitchen to the bedroom, wedding to funeral, dress and customs. <br/><br/>Currently on show is an exhibition of beadwork and embroidery. They are simply impressive. Besides using multi-coloured silk and gold threads to embroider table cloths, handkerchiefs, wedding banners, shoes, handbags, table runners and so on, their women, who are called ""nyonyas"" use colourful minuscule glass beads (the best I am told were from Venice, Italy and the tinier the beads the better the pieces will be regarded, especially by demanding mothers and mother-in-laws) to richly embellish their handiworks. Many hours of painstaking work done by the nyonyas have produced the exquisite pieces now on display at the museum. They have to be seen to be fully appreciated and marvelled at. <br/><br/>*I have personally witnessed the stringing of the tiny glass beads to embroider women shoe tops called kasut manek-manek by my late aunts and mother to know how much skill, work and time is involved.<br/><br/>The exhibition ends on 26 March 2017.<br/>Address: 39 Armenian Street<br/>Opening hours: 10 am to 7 pm daily, on Friday it opens till 9 pm."

Ruairi O,128,Jun 2016,June 2016,50,Excellent insight into Singapore's multicultural background,"Lovely museum, fabulous building. It focuses on the peranakan (families with a Malay mother and foreign father), their lives, beliefs, roles in Singapore society and history. We arrived in the afternoon just as a free English-language guided tour was starting (thank you, Robert), which was excellent and then left time to back round and see other areas or revisit especially interesting exhibits."
HokieGirl1999,13,Jun 2016,June 2016,20,Too crowded,I really wanted to see this museum but it was packed with tour groups. There was absolutely no way to see any of the exhibits and the mouse of the children was distracting.  Left after about 15 minutes. Very disappointing
Sue J,98,Jun 2016,June 2016,50,Really interesting museum in beautiful building,This museum provides a fascinating insight into the lifestyle of the Peranakan people. The wedding displays are particularly interesting
Bearie241,130,Jun 2016,June 2016,40,Good place to learn about Baba Culture,This is a place that is fully packed with the objects showing the unique Peranakan culture in Singapore. Worth a half day visit.
cazza13_13,43,Jun 2016,March 2016,50,interesting step into history,I thought this would be a quick trip through this museum - boy was I wrong! I found the exhibits fascinating and a real insight into the Peranakan people. Well worth the time spent there and I will be going back to see what I missed the first time
Wai Meng Y,272,Jun 2016,June 2016,30,Informative and thorough,"I have not been to this museum before, and since Singaporeans get to visit museums for free, why not bring my family to learn a bit about one aspect of Singapore culture.<br/><br/>The building was formerly Tao Nan School, and was refurbished extensively to become the Peranakan Museum. There are three storeys of exhibits, showing how the Peranakans are widespread not just in Singapore, but also in the region, their culture, food, architecture and so on. Many Peranakans have made significant contributions to the communities they live in, and many aspects of their culture are a fusion of the Chinese and Malay cultures. Because most of them are wealthy, the possessions they have highlight their wealth very well. For example, the porcelain wares they use (and give away in marriages), the exquisite furniture and their decorative elements, are just two examples.<br/><br/>Worth visiting to understand the Peranakan culture, an aspect of Singapore diversity in early and modern days."
ukare4me,127,Jun 2016,October 2015,40,Best museum of Singapore,Of all the museums I ve visited in Singapore it is the best . it has a larger collection and atleast can be qualified as a Museum.
moniker11,438,Jun 2016,June 2016,30,Interesting information - uninteresting set up,"This museum is laid out in  a very old-fashioned way and doesn't have much in the way of interactive displays or variations in presentations. Nevertheless, the topic is fascinating if you have an interest in history and ethno-history."
Travellingraewyn,53,Jun 2016,June 2016,40,Well presented cultural history museum,"An interesting museum for those curious about Peranakan culture and their contribution to Singapore's development.  Exhibits had plenty of audio stops as well as information boards in all key languages.  The galleries are arranged in an easy flowing layout over 3 floors, in a lovely old colonial building.  Touching of  many of the pieces is encouraged and allowed.  We easily covered the exhibition in a couple of hours, reading most panels.  Guided tours also available.  Keep an eye open for the bronze statue of a cat on the entrance stairs.  A lovely tribute to a former stray adopted by the museum."
FanThomas2016,53,Jun 2016,June 2016,50,Great insight into a unique culture,This museum is a must for anybody slightly interested in philanthropy and history. It explains a lot and showcases a short but intense time of typical and unique Singaporean culture. An eye opener and another proof how perfectly organised Singapore treats its treasures.
Thorbourne62,236,Jun 2016,July 2015,40,Must visit if you are interested in the history of Singapore.,The Peranakan history is Singapore's history. Great information and examples of Peranakan furniture and ceramics. The personal history of Peranakan families really makes for some interesting reading. Worth visiting.
Kirilinka,152,May 2016,May 2016,40,Museum of Unique Culture,"This is a place of must visit. Most tourists come to SGP and watch sights, but they should know more about the history of this amazing city-state. And Peranakan Museum is one of such places to visit to know more about the Chinese who came to this place and formed a new culture together with the inhabitants. <br/>Arts, crafts, designs, history and culture of Baba and Nyonya, i.e. Peranakan is highlighted in the Museum. Recommended."
Rick M,26,May 2016,May 2016,50,Few hours of SG history,"Wandered in not knowing what to expect. A very reasonably priced attraction. Took the English guided tour which was fun, and even if I missed something i was able to continue to wander around and fill in the gaps. Great way to get a chronological and cultural perspective of Singapore history. Really helped understand Singapore. I was alone so it was a perfect way to spend some time and take in what interested me, at my own pace."
Traveller_Green037,149,May 2016,May 2016,40,History Repeats,This is a museum of how the mix between the locals and the invaders integrated.  Reminded myself of Mexico and other places how the cultures mix and carry some of the traditions of all the cultures that become part of the family.
Nicky J,52,May 2016,May 2016,50,Wonderful cultural experience ,If you visit Singapore then this museum a must see....you are shown just what makes up a Singaporean the exhibits take you back to how races of people's from indochina and Asia came together in this wonderful place.<br/>I recommend the free guided tour at 11.00 and 14.00 our guide was brilliant she brought the exhibits to life.......
samtan71,133,May 2016,May 2016,40,Nice Museum,A very good effort by the donors who made this museum a reality. It may be a small museum but it has the essential exhibits and activities to engage the young and old with Singapore's unique ethnic group.
MelbourneJade,164,May 2016,May 2016,50,Wonderful insight into Peranakan life,"My husband and I visited this museum and found it very informative. The museum is over 3 floors and there were many photos and displays. The history of Peranakan is explained in great detail and there were many displays of clothes, chinaware, furniture etc."
BarryKeane301,37,May 2016,August 2015,40,Singapore History,We visited the museum as part of our list of places to see. It gives a wonderful perspective of early life in Singapore and the part the Peranakans played in Singapore's development
BlueCupboard,80,May 2016,December 2015,40,Interesting Visit ,I have a particular interest in Peranakan culture and history so loved visiting this museum and viewing the lovely ceramics and fabrics traditionally associated with the Peranakan people. I really wish I'd gone for a guided tour though as although there are notes by the exhibits I think I would have gained more from a guide explaining the background to some of the pieces. I'll just have to go back again!
liming,226,May 2016,February 2016,50,Fascinating Museum,"I have a love of antiques and decorative arts and found the Peranakan Museum a real treat. We waited 10 minutes for the organized tour to begin and glad we did. A very knowledgeable French woman took us through the museum explain the culture and background of the Peranakans. Beautiful examples of porcelain, textiles, clothing, furnishings and more. A real eye opener on the distinct decorative arts embraced by the Peranakan people."

Pavitralrao,173,Apr 2016,April 2016,50,For all you culture vultures,"We went to the  Peranakan museum  because we wanted our two boys to learn about the Singapore culture and its people.  It was a short cab ride to the museum.  The museum itself is in a beautiful old Singapore style , and we definitely got what we were searching for in the museum  The entrance fee is SD$6, and here is the best part: it comes with an hour long guided tour of the museum. Our guide was exceptional, and my boys came out of the museum learning something new!  Isn't that what museums are for? Love it.  Definitely would do this museum if you have some extra time, and feel like you could use some cultural tour of this amazing country."
Bening M,76,Apr 2016,April 2016,40,I enjoy the experience,"I visit this museum just out of curiosity. Luckily, the timing was just nice because there was a free tour with the guide. The guide showed us the prominent collection and gave a very clear explanation about the Peranakan culture. The food, the marriage, the religion, including the death. <br/><br/>This museum did not have huge amount of collection, it will not take soooo muuuuch time to explore and learn things in this museum."
Rita0001,86,Apr 2016,March 2016,50,Search this Place Out:  I Really Helps One Understand Singapore,"This is not a place that shows up on many travel searches but a ex-pat friend of mine recommended it and so we went.  What a good decision that was. <br/><br/> Peranakan is defined as a native-born person with mixed racial ancestry.  What a delight to see that viewed as a source of pride rather than a struggle with ethnicity and diversity..  It is a true celebration of Singapore culture...warts and all.  The displays are vivid enough that I believe children over the age of 8 would enjoy this.  Even though the museum is not particularly large, allow at least two so you have time to learn the fine point of the various displays."
Silviani Sri R,199,Apr 2016,April 2016,40,Good ,"Now I understand the different between City/jawi/hokian. Peranakan not only Chinese-Malay, but also Hindi or Indian Moslem. The collections only about Chinese-Malay heritage. No Hindi or Jawi Collection"

NinaAsia,435,Apr 2016,April 2016,30,If you are genuinely interested in Peranakan culture,"Since the last time I visited the museum, I noticed that they had made some changes. <br/><br/>For me, the biggest attraction about this place is the Nonya handicraft but very often, I find that the lighting is too dim for visitors to appreciate the fine beadwork. <br/><br/>In addition, some exhibits were not in working order. So that was kind of disappointing for those who wished to listen to a typical conversation by a Nonya.<br/><br/>I wish they had more about the music and dance the Peranakans enjoyed."
sueheim,142,Apr 2016,March 2016,50,An interesting collection of Peranakan history,"Loved how this museum brought you through the life of a Perankan, through various life stages -- including wedding, death, both rich and poor. I also liked how there was a gallery devoted to famous Peranakans -- so many females made their mark! The guard in the kitchen area spent time explaining to me -- an American -- how this kitchen was what his home looked like when he was growing up. He was proud to take the time pointing out items of interest, explaining how this was the woman's domain (men daren't enter!). I'm not certain how many Americans enter this museum, and many others wandering the gallerys often didn't speak much English, but the Peranakans who were there were proud of their heritage and didn't mind doing a bit of bragging. Definitely recommend stopping in and spending a few hours. Do not miss the gift shop. The china and beadwork alone is fascinating -- worth taking a few tokens home as momentos of a interesting culture."
suzan2014,27,Apr 2016,March 2016,50,Fascinating history of Chinese migration to Singapore,"This museum is not too large so you can see most of it before getting tired. History of Chinese community development in Singapore is quite interesting even if you think you already know a lot about the subject.  Easy to access, reasonable ticket fee."
Europelover2014,"2,095",Apr 2016,April 2016,50,What a nice surprise!,We were delighted by this museum and learned so much about the culture.  We arrived just after a guided tour started.  The guide was wonderful.  The signage in the museum is superb; we visited some exhibits without the guide and found it all very well presented.  The artifacts are beautiful and I'm so pleased we had the opportunity to learn about this group of Singaporeans.

I was so pleased with the guided tour I took as we were guided through all aspects of the Peranakan's history and traditions. The tour is free of charge."
Judyannechan,114,Mar 2016,March 2016,40,Very interesting,"The museum is located in a lovely old Chinese school. We were lucky to have a guided tour which made it all the more interesting.  Unfortunately the sound system was down so we couldn't see the video, nor experience the sounds that accompanied the various exhibits.  Our guide was a lovely lady who could tell us about all the Peranakan exhibits.  Most people don't know much about this cultural group.  I found it very interesting.  There is a tiny gift shop attached to the museum.  In the next building is a Peranakan restaurant called True Blue.  It has the ambience of a Peranakan home and quite worth the visit after viewing the museum."
Leonard C,101,Mar 2016,March 2016,50,Outstanding Unique Museum,"The Peranakan Museum is a relatively small museum located in an accessible part of Singapore.  Its focus is on the Peranakans or Straits Chinese community, a unique cultural group found primarily in Malaysia and Singapore.  The Paranakans originated in China, India, Philippines, and Indonesia and moved to Singapore and Malaysia (Malacca and Penang), intermarried and adopted many of cultural norms of the ruling English.  They became traders, lawyers, doctors and other professionals. The Peranakans were and continue to be a mélange of cultures with Chinese dominant. The museum now in a beautifully restored Colonial building is devoted to origins and cultural attributes of the Peranakans. There were exhibits and discussions regarding weddings, language, fashion, religion, public life, and food.  There were several audios that added to the written and visual material.  The museum is a well worth a visit."

Recommended!"
Duncan60,108,Mar 2016,March 2016,40,Historic Singapore families,"Very nice museum if you want to get a feel for the people who were important in the life and evolving Singapore. Lots of interesting pictures, furniture and fashion, plus the children can collect impressed stamps as they go around with you. There is something of interest for everyone and this museum does not have a shop for you to end up in at the end.  Not expensive either.  Seniors only pay $3. Adults $6."
Kabayan a,99,Mar 2016,October 2015,40,good museum to learn peranakan,"this museum is different. As its name, peranakan, you can learn about peranakan culture, which is a melting pot between Chinese, Malay and arabic.<br/><br/>some of the collections are even from outside Singapore. Good one."

TravellerAv,41,Mar 2016,March 2016,40,Highly educational,"I went to this museum with a girlfriend last week and loved it! Not at all what I expected but then again I'd never heard of this ethnic group. I'd definitely recommend taking the free tour around the museum - such an insight and the tour guides are simply beautiful! A more quiet, alternate museum to visit in Singapore."

The rich displays are beautifully presented in a beautifully restored Peranakan building.  The Peranakan culture is amazing  and unfortunately unknown in the Western world.  It is a fascinating outing for an afternoon.  <br/>Their museum shop is a gem."
Harvey G,106,Feb 2016,January 2016,50,A Great Small Museum,"We have been to many museums throughout the world and have found the best ones to be those that focus on a single topic and don't try to appeal to all comers. The Peranakan Museum fits that bill perfectly. The museum was recommended to us by our tour guide, but my wife and I visited it on our own. Allow at least two hours and try to visit during a time when you can join one of the daily guided tours (included in the price of admission).  You will learn so much more about the Peranakan culture by joining one of these tours than by simply walking around. The museum is situated in a three story building and has a very small gift shop on the ground floor. To be honest, I had never heard anything about the Peranakans before visiting this museum so everything I learned was fascinating. I highly recommend a visit to this museum."
fortgirlCA,14,Feb 2016,February 2016,50,An unexpected find,"Curious to learn a little about the local culture I arrived, by chance, in time for a one-hour guided tour.  Three hours later I reluctantly said good bye to our guide.  A proud Peranakan himself, his love of Singapore and his knowledge of the Peranakan culture was simply amazing. He turned the museum experience into a carefully woven story of people, things, and events that made me feel I was inside the home of his baba and nonya. I came away with a rich understanding of the past and present, as well as an appreciation for the universality of the Peranakan story.  Not bad for the $6 entrance fee.  <br/><br/>If you go (and I highly recommend you do) be sure to time your visit to take advantage of the volunteer-led tour. And definitely spend time exploring the wedding experience. I wish I could've explored the museum's collections some more and am seriously thinking of returning to do just that. For a small museum, it certainly packs a big punch."

Not only do the exhibits change, which means you will see something new each time, but my favourite piece a wonderful beaded tablecloth enchants me every time I visit.  It's so beautifully coloured all hand made from the tiniest of beads and showcases the huge artistry that t his work can display.<br/><br/>The museum is never crowded, and yet the building too is a heritage icon. - Do visit you won't be disappointed."

Echo419,208,Jan 2016,January 2016,50,An interesting find!,"Was looking to find a place to visit with my mum and my grandmother. I had to find a place that was appropriate for them.<br/><br/>The Peranakan Museum did not disappoint! It is filled with cultural heritage and is rich in information. Three floors worth of history including sections on weddings, famous peranakans, peranakan food and more!"
vivianyeong,107,Jan 2016,March 2015,40,Insightful,"This museum tends to be overlooked because the more famous ones are SAM and National Museum, but this museum has its own fair share of history as well.<br/><br/>Peranakans are a very interesting group, and are usually very famous for their food. In this museum, they have a lot to share about their culture, history etc. I really learnt a lot from visiting this museum."
Jessica,206,Jan 2016,December 2015,40,Cultural Indulgence,"This museum admits free on festive days. It is about 3 floors high and has plenty of categories for us to explore in. Many cultural artifacts, a must-go if you like cultures."
LBW63,17,Jan 2016,January 2016,50,Wonderful insight to a fascinating culture.,"I thoroughly enjoyed our walk through this Museum. I gained a better understanding of the culture and wonderful 'melting pot' of nationalities and races that is the modern Singapore that we know today. It is with such a sense of pride that their heritage and traditions are explained. The Peranakans have a strong sense of tolerance and respect for their land and culture that is to be commended. It wouldn't have been easy to assimilate with so many different races and ideals, but they seemed to have done so great success. Thank you for such a wonderful insight to a part of your history."
stpn_fz,524,Jan 2016,December 2015,40,Unique.,"- Occupying the premises of the former Tao Nan School, this is one of Singapore's few buildings dedicated to the preservation of Straits Chinese (Peranakan) culture.<br/>- Have an informative, sensory experience here while you explore various aspects of the unique culture: elaborate rituals, fine porcelain and embroidery, etc."
Denyse T,12,Jan 2016,January 2016,50,Stunning presentation of this unique culture,"With very limited time available to show a young American visitor (25) around I took her to the Peranakan Museum. We were there for under two hours and it was such a memorable experience for her that she is still mesmerized by the intricacies, colour and glory of this wonderful culture.<br/>We were there on a Sunday and no payment was required of visitors (Singaporeans go in for free). But they often have these free times - although a donation would, of course, be welcome.<br/>A pity that a restaurant or snack bar would be too cumbersome because a taste of the food would have been the decoration on the icing of the cake."
JN65,233,Jan 2016,December 2015,40,"Interesting, enjoyable, worth a visit",Well laid out museum in an attractive building. The text boxes tell the story clearly and well. The exhibits hold your interest and there's plenty to see. I admit I didn't even know what a Peranakan was before I got to Singapore so I learned something new and I enjoyed it.
Inexology,"1,003",Jan 2016,September 2015,40,Understanding Peranakan Culture,I was wowed and amazed by the in-depth tour that explained about Peranakan Culture. I planned to go to the museum for quite sometime and fortunately able to find the time during my short trip to Singapore with Hubby. We learned about the building which used to be a school as well as how Peranakan culture spreaded out on different areas due to tradies' influence. One of the most amazing thing was the numerous amount of crockeries that one family could have and each piece looked really beautiful!
HappyTravellller,473,Jan 2016,April 2015,30,Very Peranakan,"Anything n everything about the history n present of peranakan. Quite a educating museum, not a fancy museum but worth a visit."
Auntie_Em7,72,Dec 2015,February 2015,40,Just passing through,"The Singapore Footprints walking tour took us past this place. Unfortunately, since I was leaving the next day, I didn't get a change to go in and visit due to the lack of time. Nevertheless, I'm glad I got to see at least a glimpse of the place before I left the country!"
BristolKiki,92,Dec 2015,November 2015,40,Well designed and interesting,This museum is housed in a lovely old building and all of the exhibits have been thoughtfully laid out in different rooms. There are some beautiful items on display and the exhibits are based around life events such as weddings. I loved this approach and felt that it really offered an insight into the unique Peranakan culture.
Anna Marie G,25,Dec 2015,June 2015,50,A Nice Introduction about the Peranakans,The museum gives a glimpse about the culture of these people.  The museum is informative and entertaining as well. It depicts the life of Peranakan from birth to death.
Supertourists,153,Dec 2015,December 2015,40,Interesting and entertaining,"Recently opened in a beautiful building not far from National museum of Singapore. Good collection of furniture and porcelain, costumes and pictures. Free guides. Not as good as Peranakan museum in Penang."
AdoleTravel,73,Dec 2015,December 2015,50,Beautiful museum!,This is one the less popular museums in Singapore but it is certainly worth visiting as it offers great explanations to the Peranakan culture in Singapore.
60YOworldcitizens,55,Dec 2015,December 2015,50,Don't miss it,A beautiful building. We took the guided tour and were fascinated with the exhibits and with the guide's explanations. Really worth a visit.
linusthomson,13,Dec 2015,December 2015,30,Not much to see,"They are now having a '50 great Peranakans' exhibition. It is slightly disappointing as they are only showing the biography of these people with limited possessions of those people are displayed. And there is not much to see, cause each section is rather limited in terms of exhibits."
ZahraMargautami,37,Dec 2015,January 2015,40,Good way to learn about Singapore history and the people's culture,"Recommended for you who like to visit museum,and have a big curiosity, this museum has a complete understanding about Singapore culture."

This little gem of a Museum honors the Peranakan people, who are the predominant citizens of Singapore.  This traces their history, famous people ( LKY, included) and gives you a sense of their art and culture.....Wonderful little Restaurant nextdoor serves homemade Peranaken food...Lovely blend of Malay and Chinese."
wilsongirl,466,Dec 2015,December 2015,50,"Finally, a good museum",A great museum covering the history of Singapore and it's people.<br/><br/>A lovely building both inside and out with lots of interesting things to see and iteractive  exhibits for the young or young at heart.<br/><br/>There was a group of children singing Christmas songs in the foyer that were really cute.<br/><br/>Best of all admittance to the museum was free - a word you don't hear in Singapore.
AnitaK22,129,Dec 2015,July 2015,40,A Touch Of History,Lovely if you love Straits Chinese history. Great artifacts. Small and quaint museum. Enjoyed it. Friendly staff. A must visit for history buffs.
YauKui,41,Dec 2015,November 2015,50,Peranakan Museum's unique culture,"The Straits Chinese Peranakan culture is unique to SE Asia and stretches from Phuket to Indonesia, but it is particularly concentrated in Penang, Malacca and Singapore.   Chinese traders came in the NE Monsoon when the winds were right and they could not return until the SE monsoon season started.   So many stayed and intermarried with locals.   Others moved permanently from about 8 generations ago.   So their culture of furniture, china, jewelry, processions, funerals, homes, and architecture are very different from any other.  It also tended to be a somewhat Matriarchal Society.  The Peranakan Museum in Singapore has a beautiful selection of these artifacts and it is best if you can find out on the internet when one of the free guided tours (by volunteers) is going on as this really adds interest.  We learnt a lot.  The last time we went, we dined in the adjacent True Blue Restaurant which has great Peranakan food.   It is pricey and has had some mixed reviews, however the last time we went it was first class with wonderful  such as Ayam Buah Keluak (Chicken with black nuts), Petai (Stinky beans), Ngoh Hiang (Five Spice Meat Roll) and other Peranakan delicacies.   A truly memorable day out was had by us when we went last."

AntAtoll,15,Dec 2015,November 2015,40,very interesting,"Plan to spend a couple of hours in this old school that has been refurbished into a very interesting museum.  The artifacts here are amazing, especially the traditional ceremonial items relating to Peranakan weddings."

S P,139,Nov 2015,November 2015,50,Interesting culture,"I've been interested in Peranakan culture for only a short time and I love how this museum takes you through the journey of a peranakan from birth to death and language to food. Everything is displayed and explained in detail and you can even sit and listen while you have more aspects of this culture explained to you through a video. The museum is blessedly cool thanks to the air conditioning, allowing you enough time to browse through all the exhibits. It's pretty easy to navigate and has a very reasonable entry fee. Well worth the visit!"
Mathilda J,157,Nov 2015,July 2015,50,Well presented museum,"Really interesting museum explaining one of Singapore's cultural groups. Beautifully restored building housing the displays.

amandaebner,54,Nov 2015,June 2015,40,Fun little museum in the heart of downtown,"Often overlooked amidst a sea of other museums (such as the nearby ACM), the Peranakan Museum provides a great deal of cultural value at a relatively low price, all within a traditional setting.<br/><br/>We learned a great deal about one of the native Singaporean cultures, costumes, and cuisines, all while enjoying a great guided tour.  For first-time visitors to Singapore, this is a must-stop!<br/><br/>Don't forget to grab some Peranakan goodies at the gift shop before you head out - you won't find these items elsewhere."
Orcacorn,23,Nov 2015,November 2015,50,Cultural tidbit,This is a very well done and interesting museum that is worth checking out.  It's inexpensive at $6 per adult and I recommend enjoying the exhibits and cool air.  The building itself is lovely.
AS T,173,Nov 2015,March 2015,50,Excellent if you love Peranakan culture,Good for family outing with friends. It's free for citizen and PRs. <br/>Cozy environment and you get to see Peranakan lifestyles in the ... 60s

VernLand,315,Nov 2015,November 2015,50,very informative and interesting,"This museum arises the awareness towards the ethnical group of the Peranakan, which itself had a big place in Singapore's history. Origins, Appearnce in Public Life, Food, Weddings, Religion.. this museum represents all aspects of the Peranakan people."
Timtom57,143,Nov 2015,October 2015,40,A nice surprise.,"Singapore is an interesting mix of people and this museum highlights that so well. I particularly liked the photographic exhibition on the ground floor floor that set the stage for the rest of the displays. The marriage rituals were also very interesting.We had lunch in a nearby restaurant, ""True Blue"" which also runs the Museums' gift shop. Give both places a visit."
SuzBana,51,Nov 2015,November 2015,50,Cultural Gem,"Fortunately, I stumbled on this museum, arriving just in time for a free tour. This is a unique culture with a rich history. The exhibits and displays are beautiful and well-designed. There is a small fee for visitors. Allow 60-90 minutes. Don't miss the section on weddings."
thesmdm,"1,318",Nov 2015,November 2015,50,Neat Museum - Enchanced by a great guide,"Neat museum, explain the influence of the Peranakan society/background on the bringing together of Singaporean culture.

DKF808,189,Nov 2015,November 2015,50,Nice history of the blended Peranakan people.,"This museum cost $6 SD and was a pretty good introduction to the Peranakan peoples.  It covers Traditions, Religion(s), Food, Business Titans, influential Peranakans, etc.  Well worth the price of admission.  You can probably see this place in about an hour.  Nice air-conditioned distraction."
Dublin Bayb,61,Nov 2015,November 2015,40,Take the guided tour!,"Located in a beautiful heritage building from the Victorian era, the Peranakan Museum is a museum of social history and anthropology that comes alive thanks to the volunteer tour guides. ""William"" was our guide on a generous free tour that lasted a highly entertaining 60 minutes. His love for history and storytelling was utterly engaging, and he interacted with everyone on the tour by involving us in the exhibits and answering all our questions. This is a unique look into Singaporean life and culture from the past, and well worth a visit. Although the Museum is free to Singaporean residents (the entrance fee for tourists was $6), the little gift shops are quite pricey. Don't be fooled by the tiny entrance to the gift shop - there is a good choice of local crafts to purchase there. There are two shops in fact, on either side of the front door, and one of them serves local style coffee."
Vivyanti,42,Nov 2015,December 2014,50,Absolutely worth visiting.,"I went to this museum together with my dad, little brother and m eldest sister. The museum is filled with the stories we knew about the Peranakan way of living.<br/><br/>At each exhibition, my dad would tell us about his own stories including his own wedding ceremonies.<br/><br/>I learned so much about the Peranakan culture at this museum and would recommend this place to my friends."
Cartertravels15,192,Nov 2015,October 2015,50,So good,"We weren't going to go as only a couple of hours before leaving Singapore.So very glad we did.Had a brilliant volunteer guide who was a descendant on her grandmothers side of the Peranakan.Such an interesting tour and amazing history the Peranakan people have had.Visit the shops either side,nice souvenirs."
KMCanberra,73,Nov 2015,October 2015,40,Interesting insight,"Like people with convict ancestors in Australia, the mixed-background people of Singapore are claiming their place in the national story. This building is worth seeing anyway, but the displays are very good. We didn't look at everything, but there was enough of interest to make it very worthwhile seeing."
Olga B,35,Nov 2015,December 2014,40,true SG people history,"Gives a good understanding of SG history from multinational population point of view. Not to be missed, takes only 30 min."
timjahja,19,Oct 2015,January 2015,40,Understanding Peranakan Concept,Was here early thi year (January 2015) When I was in the neighbourhood. It is interesting as the Museum gave a proper information on what is Peranakan is all about.
Reece G,109,Oct 2015,October 2015,40,A Cultural Gem.,"The Peranakan Museum is a cultural gem, which we would have missed, had it not been for our Singaporean Food &amp; Culture guide, Leo Loo, recommending it to us.<br/>Housed in a beautiful old school there are 9 galleries on 2-3 floors covering the various aspects of the Peranakan people (whom I had never heard of)  and their unique FUSION S.E. Asian culture.  <br/>The 9 galleries showcase their Origins, Food, Feasting, Fashion, Weddings etc with some quite stunning exhibits.  The beadwork on some tablecloths is breathtaking.  And I loved the photographic gallery of the Peranakan people, where they explained what it meant to be a Peranakan. Utterly charming.<br/>Don't leave it for a rainy day to visit it's cool interior is a welcome respite from the outside humidity and you will learn a lot.   Plus it has a well stocked gift shop and cafe outside."

Jeff206,521,Oct 2015,October 2015,50,Lessons In Anthropology,"This was yet another one of Singapore's greatly laid out museums that tells who the Peranakans were, where they came from, and what their lives were like once arriving.<br/>Many cool things on display (complete with descriptions), and lots of really fascinating items to observe and take pictures of.<br/>This is the third museum that I've visited in Singapore (with the other two being the National Museum of Singapore and the Singapore Art Museum), and this one was yet another outstanding place to spend a part of my afternoon and learning about a bit of history.<br/>This was also the third museum in which I did NOT feel like ""Oh it's a museum, this is boring"". I learned alot and it was a place I think many will enjoy when they go there."
Pak Soon L,760,Oct 2015,October 2015,40,Unique Peranakan Museum,We learned a great deal from the exhibits about the Peranakan in Singapore and Malaysia. Very well researched and documented. Very well worth a visit.
reogirl,28,Oct 2015,October 2015,50,Learn about Singapore ,We visited here on our second trip.  It was interesting to see and learn about the early settlers in Singapore.  It has some interactive displays if you are into that.  We had fun getting our paper wheel embossed at all the different displays. To read about the people and to see the artifacts was interesting after doing all the regular tourist attractions.  The tablecloth with over a million beads was just beautiful. Definately worth a trip.
Prisillia,55,Oct 2015,August 2015,50,one of my favourite,"if you really love about culture, history and peranakan you must come and visit this museum. all property in the museum really nice and informative.

Joyce M,50,Sep 2015,September 2015,50,wonderful,This museum is extremely interesting. We were facinated by all the exhibits. The film presentation was very helpful. All the staff were very helpful and friendly. We also visited the shop and bought some peranakan spoons for our daughters birthday and they were expertly wrapped by a very nice lady called Shirley. Thanks to all.
GitaK0099,93,Sep 2015,September 2015,50,Slice of real people of Singapore,This is an excellent museum to get your hands around the local people of Singapore - the Peranakans - and their lives during the boom days of Singapore. Try to go on a museum tour - the guide I had - a male from England - was entertaining and had excellent knowledge.
Gayle A,9,Sep 2015,July 2015,20,Charming building,A charming old building filled with very interesting things. It's a bit out of the way. The little shop is very quaint.
tirelesstraveller204,89,Sep 2015,September 2015,30,Nothing special...,"This museum is in a beautifully restored building but I found it quite sterile compared to the one in Penang which was set up more like a real house showing how the family lived. Having said that, the exhibits are well organised and displayed."
Richard L,50,Sep 2015,September 2015,40,Nice museum and nice venue,"Well explained museum, with all aspect of peranakans represented (language, religion, wedding...). <br/>Definitely a must do if you are into history."

I must say the museum did a great job in bringing the culture and lifestyles of the Peranakans to live. It also runs regular yearly special edition exhibitions to give a glimpse of different aspects of the culture so don't miss them!"
Akmar A,107,Sep 2015,August 2015,40,A great cultural museum.,I love the knowledge i gained from visiting this place.<br/><br/>I feel at home instantly upon entering this musuem. <br/><br/>The displays are bright and cheerful.<br/>Especially Nyonya attires. Reminds me of my late grandmother as she was a Nyonya herself.
Vuvie,146,Sep 2015,May 2015,40,Peranakan culture preserved in a compact little museum!,I love peranakan culture and was extremely impressed with this small but compact museum.<br/><br/>Just the soundbites of peranakan speech is not accurate at all. Though everything else is very accurate!
Caverkat,426,Sep 2015,August 2015,30,Interesting,There was a small entrance fee. The museum was well laid and not busy making it easy to spend time wandering around looking at the exhibits. I was fascinated by the Perankan wedding setup and the video presentation.
World_o_choice,402,Sep 2015,August 2015,50,Immersing in Peranakan culture,"A unique experience not to be missed. Situated in the Peranakan enclave of Singapore, this place breathes and speaks of everything Peranakan in its true sense. It is a place where there is a personal touch and the learning is tailored and detailed."
eyoh,42,Sep 2015,August 2015,50,Well worth a visit when in Singapore,Go for the tour - check the times. It is worth it. Then walk to Fort Canning Park or to Funan Digimall for electronics.
worldtourist21,240,Sep 2015,September 2015,40,Worth a Visit,For those who know very little about Peranakan history this is very impressive.  It details a lot of the origins of the Peranankan peoples and the exhibits are really interesting.  The building itself has an amazing histroy and it is in a quiet part of the city well accessed by the MRT.
siowchuan,26,Sep 2015,August 2015,50,A rare treat,"If one of your ancestors is a peranakan or if you are a history buff, do not miss this museum located in the heart of Singapore. When I was there in August 2015, there was a exhibition paying tribute to 50 peranakans. The original peranakans are those of Straits ancestry who had married the local women in the British Straits Settlements. They have their own unique culture and some of them were great philanthropists.<br/>There is even a statue of Queen Victoria in the lobby of the Museum. <br/>The words on the plinth read:<br/>""This statue of Queen Victoria was presented by the Chinese community of Singapore in the year of Her Majesty's Jubilee to be placed in the Government House as a memorial of the loyal affection of Her Majesty's Chinese subjects and of their gratitude for the benefit of her rule."""
Bee4,143,Sep 2015,March 2015,50,"Colourful, interesting, Peranakan (Straits Chinese) culture in a nutshell.","My favourite Singapore museum!  Located in a lovely old school building, this museum is full of colourful exhibits depicting the customs, dress and uniquely decorative household items found in the homes of welltodo Straits Chinese families.  Their culture reflected the combined tastes of male Chinese immigrants who married local Malay women.  Well worth visiting."
Nanna2go,30,Sep 2015,September 2015,50,Now I know about Peranakans!,"I wasn't going here until I discovered that the National Museum and Asian Civilisations Museum were both closed until mid Sept. I'm really glad I went, I didn't know what a Peranakan was, it give me a real insight into this history of Singapore, it's a small museum and tells a worthwhile story."
sglover,55,Sep 2015,September 2015,40,A slice of (Peranakan) life,"I spent about 90 minutes in the museum, by which time I was flagging. It was most interesting and enjoyable and covered a lot. Not bad for an entrance fee of only $6. <br/><br/>I suggest you could take some good quality paper along (maybe of different colours), especially if you have children of any age! There are manual embossing tools which will emboss various lucky Peranakan creatures (e.g. phoenix, dragon). This nearly 61 year old child enjoyed embossing his guide to the museum. I wish I had had some really good paper. It would have been much more fun!<br/><br/>You are permitted to take photos without flash, and I saw people were using their cameras or phones with no flash."
Melissa G,120,Aug 2015,August 2015,40,Good and informative visit. Lots to read.,"A beautiful building and a good layout. Very informative and interesting for those interested in Singaporean history and multiculturalism. <br/><br/>There is also a scavenger hunt type of activity that kids can do on their own by collecting press stamps from various rooms in the museum and by doing so, learning about Peranakan culture. I think, however, that the museum could be slightly more interactive for kids."
Janet C,48,Aug 2015,August 2015,50,The Flavour of LOCAL HISTORY,"Great museum to appreciate the flavour of the local history in relation to the different ethnic races living in Singapore.

A small museum over three levels, it is cleverly sectorised into different theme to allow the visitors to understand the Peranakan culture better in systematic way.<br/><br/>A regret would be there isn't enough exhibits from the traditional Peranakan culture. There are however a lot of posters mentioning and explaining the forefathers of Singapore history (whom mostly are also kinda related to the Peranakan culture)."
ytlouise,102,Aug 2015,September 2014,50,New insights into a subculture.,"A Singaporean by birth, I was totally amazed to find out there is so much about Singapore that i do not know.

Kudos the to the National Heritage Board for growing from strength to strength and nurturing our cultural capital"
TREX100,66,Aug 2015,January 2015,40,A rare glimpse into a colourful subculture,I learned so much about the Peranakan.

Nur R,27,Aug 2015,August 2015,40,It's like getting to know more of Singaporeans better!,"It was one of the museums that I had not visited. So I went with my husband. Situated at Armenian street, a refurbished 3-storey school turned museum. The tv guides that's around the museum really helped in allowing us to understand better about the Peranakans. They are entertaining and engaging. Artefacts were really amazing and intricate. <br/><br/>My only issue is that there are no footprint stickers to really guide us on where to go at every floor. Sometimes we tend to wonder around and not pay attention to the signs above but more on the display.<br/><br/>Otherwise it was a really fun visit and very informative!"
Billy Z,"6,036",Aug 2015,August 2015,50,A story unfold in a museum,"Yes it is a small museum but it is not small if you take the time understanding every single piece of exhibits in a systematic manner to unfold the story of the Peranakan community. Every piece of the collections are all very carefully selected and well presented and string together in tracing the history, cultures and customs of the Peranakans, with a large section devoted to the rituals in a traditional 12-days celebration of a Peranakan wedding. <br/><br/>Whether it is a piece of furniture, jewelry, cloth or dinnerware used in any occassion, much efforts have been put into telling the story behind them with many of the artefacts on loan from private collections, reflectng the seriousness of the curator in arranging these rare and high quality heritage materials.<br/><br/>An ongoing exhibition on 50 of the great Peranakans in Singapore also gives a refreshing insights to their remarkable contribution in making what Singapore is today!<br/><br/>If you are a foreign visitor to the museum, I strongly recommend that you complete the story by having a good meal in a Peranakan (aka Nyonya) Restaurant during your stays in Singapore!"
Ian569,44,Aug 2015,July 2015,40,Singapore Heritage !,The museum explains the part played in Singapore's early years by  the settlers who cam in the main from West Malaysia. We spent an hour plus going through the three floors of exhibits. There is a lift and the air conditioning is good. Gift shop and a cafe on the ground floor.
Timothy L,211,Aug 2015,January 2015,30,A dose of Peranakan culture,The family decided to take a tour of the museum. Pretty small set up and could definitely be improved in terms of the layout of the exhibits.
Kenneth1960,320,Aug 2015,August 2015,50,A good introduction to Peranakan culture,This museum is not to be missed on a visit to Singapore as it gives so many insights to the culture of this city state - a well presented museum in a lovely building.

VLKJ,"1,092",Aug 2015,August 2015,50,Excellent collection of peranakan pottery,I enjoyed looking through the exquisite quality of peranakan pottery. The way the artists did up the Phoenix and the peony intrigued me to find out. <br/><br/>Though there are many reproductions of this pottery which is priceless especially they are collected from the Qing dynasty. <br/><br/>The museum has a complete collection that I got down to studying them.
Susan A,169,Aug 2015,July 2015,50,Learning about a little known group of people,I learned so much about the mix of cultures and ethnicities at the Peranakan museum.  I did not realize Singapore was such an eclectic mix of people prior to this visit.  The exhibits were laid out in great detail as to treasured rituals and ceremonies native to the Peranakan and i particularly enjoyed the famous Singaporeans who were Peranakans and contributed so richly to the growth of the city.
Niconoel,43,Aug 2015,January 2015,50,Baba and Bibiks welcomed!,Its a little off the beaten track (ever so slightly) but its worth the time. Its great to wander around and to take it all in to learn about the peranakans. Great way to spend a few hours
VuongQuocTom,4,Jul 2015,August 2014,40,Historical museum of Singapore,"It was my first time to know about the old people in Singapore. Thought it was just from models, but I had a chance to understand more about the culture in Singapore."
Helen N,86,Jul 2015,July 2015,50,Fascinating,"A fascinating insight into Peranakan culture in Singapore. A beautiful building, not too big so for those looking for a short burst of history, perfect."
Nordo4ka,55,Jul 2015,August 2014,50,Amazing intro in Peranakan culture,"I had no idea what is Peranakan until I've visited museum. It's very modern and neat, they have great explanations and also artefacts. Cloths, daily life installations, wedding, food. It's very interesting for kids and adults. No need to read boring endless explanations like in some museums. Here is easy - just stroll around and learn. Easily can stay there 3-4 hours"
CyuutBen,228,Jul 2015,June 2015,30,Saved by the internal architecture,I have to admit we didn't find this museum overall enjoyable. Probably if you had a specific interest in Peranakan history this would be different obviously. There was some outfits that were interesting to look at. The architecture of the venue however is beautiful and quite breathtaking. I would semi-recommend based mainly on the building.
Peter B,30,Jul 2015,July 2015,50,Overwhelming  opulence from the past,"Ohboy! What a lifestyle they must have had . Never seen so much GOLD! Guides offered  (at a price ), but easy to get around yourselves. Very well worth a visit."
Passportalwaysready,138,Jul 2015,April 2015,50,A highlight of a visit to Singapore can eat before and after,The Peranakan (Chinese and Malay marriages) story is special and worth preserving since they have virtually melded into society in the region.  The artifacts and stories on exhibit are fabulous and offer a fine cultural lens into the region.
Dianne B,129,Jul 2015,July 2015,50,Well worth the visit.,"This is a very visually well laid out museum, extremely interesting and informative. And most importantly when you've had enough of the humidity outside its cool and peaceful inside."
Tdterrytodd,30,Jul 2015,June 2015,40,A Bit of Singapore History,This museum traces the  rich history of the Paranakan ancestry and its direct connection to the Singapore culture. The Docent did a great job of taking us back in time and fully explaining the customs land traditions of the Parankans.
kochiraja,57,Jul 2015,March 2015,50,A great way to understand local Singaporean culture and traditions,"Visit the museum if you want to understand local Singaporean culture and traditions. <br/><br/>The museum showcases traditional cultural artefacts and traditions of the locally born (Peranakan) Singaporeans . This is done using a thematic display of traditional artefacts, multimedia exhibits, interactive displays and dioramas. Articles of  traditional clothing,  jewelry, artifacts used during special ceremonies, household furniture and utensils are on display. There are are also life-size dioramas of rooms in a traditional peranakan house. The museum itself is housed in a beautiful traditional Peranakan house. And, there is some interesting graffiti art on display on the adjacent streets. <br/> <br/>During my visit, I noticed small groups of local school children being taken around by their teachers and being taught about Peranakan traditions. I thought this was a very  important and an impressive way to teach the younger generation of Singaporeans about their traditions.  <br/><br/>I recommend a visit to this museum if you want to understand the local traditions and culture.  And that may help you in understanding your local hosts or business associates better."

EliseTan,174,Jun 2015,July 2014,40,"Nice, Cozy and Historical Hub of the Peranakans","A very nice, cozy museum that houses many ornamental pieces of the late Peranakan heritage. The beautiful and skillfully crafted pieces on display really shows the wealthy and tasteful Paranakan culture."
BevQ1067,15,Jun 2015,March 2015,50,Beautiful architecture,This is well worth a visit just to see the beautiful architecture of the building.  This was built in the early 1900s and was originally a girls school.  This is my favorite building in Singapore
LeatherTraveller,322,Jun 2015,June 2015,40,1st Visit and will need 2nds..,Embarrassing to reveal that I didn't know this museum existed. Very glad I discovered it and learn a lot. <br/><br/>Located in a old building of more than 100 years old and surprise to learn that was the founding premises of Tao Nan Primary School. <br/><br/>The interactive videos added a sense of personal touch to the quiet displays. The embossing stamps gave visitors a mission to complete the display which is also fun for children and even some adults.<br/><br/>New takeaway was that there are different Peranakan in Indonesia and even Philippines.<br/><br/>Need to return to visit again without the limit of time especially when there are so many to see and learn.
jonharichman,88,Jun 2015,July 2014,50,"Quirky, Modern and Enjoyed the Interactive Experience","Really enjoyed the experience at the Peranakan museum because it's so full of history of Peranakan and it's has really modern and interactive experience as you're tasked to find hidden clues in rooms as you get to learn in the process. <br/><br/>I find that quite refreshing for a museum as it really helps you enjoy the learning process and while I don't remember what sort of reward did we get when we completed the quest, I enjoyed the experience immensely."
ralikirk,46,Jun 2015,November 2014,50,wonderful displays,"It is very informative and the displays are great. A lot to learn one visit might not be enough. I spent about 2 hours and had to skip some of the information but I would go back. Very interesting, good preserved articles. It was great being able to learn about the Peranakan culture. It goes in depth with the wedding ceremony, which was very interesting."
sipivu,"2,113",Jun 2015,January 2015,30,the traditional life in Indonesia,Interesting if you have never been to traditional places in Indonesia and wants to have a little education about its traditions and culture. But this is not about Singapore.
IbuJu,27,Jun 2015,June 2015,50,Very Interesting,"This museum is full of information and how the mix of cultures have developed over the years. Peranakans are the descendants of Chinese immigrants who came to to the Malay archipelago and British Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore) between the 15th and 17th centuries.<br/>I was most impressed with the wife of the late Lee Kuan Yew.<br/>Kwa Geok Choo (21/12/1920-02/10/2010)  was a pioneer advocate of Singapore women’s rights and the first Singaporean woman to graduate as a lawyer.<br/>There is so much to see from their clothing, jewelry, weddings, deaths, furniture etc.<br/>I am not a museum person, generally, but I did find this place very intersting."
Coellum,"1,273",Jun 2015,May 2015,40,Fascinating world of Malay chinese,"We had a guide who brought us to the major exhibits. It was very informative. I had never thought about how the Chinese intermarrying Malays affected the local culture. We looked at pieces that at first appeared Chinese but were actually locally made by Chinese Malays. The Malay versions tend to have brighter colors. Since these were trading families, many were prosperous. Sadly, they suffered economy decline during the Depression."
lawmochung,61,Jun 2015,June 2015,30,Ok history of Singapore ,This is very much a museum to promote the identity of Singapore.  Exhibits are nothing extraordinary but s good summary of the people that make up Singapore.
Dennis D,75,Jun 2015,May 2015,30,If you like costumes....,"i thought the displays would illustrate the struggles of these mixed-race people to adapt and survive. the museum focuses on ceremonial dress and some home furnishings. the museum is often filled with school groups, do not expect tranquil surroundings"
lonelyrunner_91,142,Jun 2015,May 2015,40,For cultural buffs,"Lovely museum with exhibits showcasing every aspect of peranakan culture s from wedding ceremony, daily rituals and even funerals  Highly recommended for those wanting to explore the cultural side of SG."
Kym S,47,May 2015,May 2015,50,Not your average museum,"I'm not a huge fan of some museums, but I was really glad I visited the Peranakan in Singapore. I love history, and the museum has a great display on the people of Peranakan origin who played key roles in the development of Singapore. Very informative, beautiful displays of artifacts, etc"
IshDewyn,655,May 2015,March 2015,50,Beautiful &amp; beautifully curated museum,"The Peranakan Museum is one of the more interesting museums I've visited - both architecturally and in terms of exhibitions. The museum strives to maintain (for the most part) the structure of the original Peranakan house the museum resides in, both externally and internally. As such, there is a lot of detail to appreciate, not only of the exhibitions hosted, but of literally the museum (building) itself. What a great way to truly preserve heritage and history.<br/><br/>In terms of exhibitions, the museum strives to capture the history and essence of the Peranakan people, and feel it does so rather comprehensively and beautifully. The exhibitions are thoroughly thought out and well curated. Definitely worth a visit.<br/><br/>Quick tip: entry to the museum, as well as most other museums, is free in the week preceding 09 August, which is Singapore's National Day. What a great way to celebrate your nation's history!"
387georgew,222,May 2015,May 2015,10,"bad visit, spoiled day at the Peranakan Museum","All places in Singpaore we ever visited were clean, nice and run by curtuous, efficient and friendly people. Not so the Peranakan Musuem that were rude, very expensive, and arrogant. And after all they did not have much to show anyway. Not worth the money"
Patricia D,4,May 2015,May 2015,40,Cultural curiosity,I tagged along a guided group. Some of the exhibits were very beautiful. <br/>The history of how this 'ethnic' group came about was most interesting. I learnt a lot. There were two school groups are up of little children. It's good to see that they are taught the Peranakan culture. I'm pleased I went. Enjoy the 45 mins or so.
chanahpat,116,May 2015,January 2015,30,Beads slippers&amp; Sarong Kubaya,I like the Peranakan Museum is the diferent design of the hand<br/>made beads slippers and the coustumes called sarong kubaya<br/> I dislike is the place is abit dark and not much to see

ct1978,26,May 2015,NA,30,Beautiful architecture ,If you like culturally significant objects like bowls and spoons and beds and furniture you'll love this place. <br/>The building is beautiful and has a very calm energy. <br/>It tells the story of the peranakan/mixed race culture. outlines wedding traditions and historical ideas. <br/>Not large.  Not to my taste. But well done.
Mitch C,41,May 2015,July 2014,50,Great museum of Singapore's heritage,"Don't miss this great and very manageable museum detailing Singapore's history and its people. Great space, with great exhibits."
Bonnie H,131,May 2015,May 2015,50,Getting to know the people,"The Peranakan developed a society in Singapore with its own language, customs and way of life. Never heard of them? This museum, very interactive, with docents available for interesting tours, is the place to go. A great respire in the middle of the day when a cool place is needed, or a retreat from the afternoon rain this is a great space. Easy to meander on your own, but follow the suggestions of the staff for a great visit."
Mohammad A,303,May 2015,NA,30,"know Peranakan people, interesting visit!","I visited Peranakan musuem today to know who are the Peranakans, because before the visit i was a bit confused thinking that they are chinese immigrants. Peranakans is a old Malay language term used to name mix blooded people. It started by Strait chinese migrating to singapore and marrying local women which resulted into hokkien peranakan race. South hindu indian marrying locals resulted into Chitty peranakan, south muslim indian marrying local resulted into Jawi peranakan. Very interesting! Visit it to know about their language, wedding ceremonies, fashion, death ceremony, and their rituals."
Lynda B,42,May 2015,May 2015,50,History always interesting,"We were taken here by a local interesting to learn about the history of the peoples of Singapore. Also to see fashion development,  furniture and religious influence ."
Joseph R,13,May 2015,May 2015,30,Narrow but nice,"I was surprised this museum focuses mainly on the Chinese Pernakan experience (more than the Chitty [Indian] or Jawi Peranakans). Still, lovely little museum. The best exhibits are the cultural connections piece and the photographs on the ground floor. Check out True Blue restaurant next door!"
WoooWho,"2,102",May 2015,May 2015,40,Good Peranakan Exhibits,"Singapore has a sizeable Peranakan (Straits-Born Chinese) population, after Malacca and Penang. <br/><br/>I am part Peranakan on my mother's side. I came here with my family to appreciate and also let my children see the Perankan way of life of yester-years.<br/><br/>The museum is spread over several floors and the exhibits are divided into themes, such as wedding, bedroom, dining themed exhibits. <br/><br/>This is a good place to immerse yourself into Peranakan culture and understand the unique heritage of Peranakans."
Eric T,24,May 2015,May 2015,40,A visit to my early childhood,"I grew up in Singapore.  The visit to the museum brings back memories of how the early settlers of the Straits lived together in harmony.  Immigrants learnt the local language, shared and practice each others culture to form the Peranakan culture.  The museum featured the life style of the early immigrants.  Unfortunate the new immigrants to Singapore do not embrace this culture."
Lucas E,38,May 2015,November 2014,40,Fascinating museum if you enjoy learning about cultures,"Singapore has a very interesting history, and this museum provides a fascinating insight into a culture I knew nothing about prior to my trip. Definitely recommend if you want to learn a little more about Singapore's cultural history. There's also a cute cat memorial out the front."

We gained free entry by presenting our Visitors map. Without this it would have only have cost a few dollars anyway. The exhibits are displayed over three floors &amp; show the History &amp; merging of a number of cultures (especially the Chinese) to produce the current Peranakan culture of today. Well worth a look."
rkambinus,165,Apr 2015,April 2015,50,Fascinating and Beautiful,"I enjoyed my visit here very much and highly recommend a visit. The Peranakan culture is beautiful explained as you progress  through the 3 floors of the museum: who the people are, what daily life was like, weddings and funerals. Stop for a fresh lemonade in the shop afterwards."

LaohuPenang,461,Apr 2015,April 2015,50,Understand Peranakan culture,"After having visited the Peranakan museums in Penang and Malakka, this one completes the trilogy and completes your understanding of the Babas and Nyonyas. The guided tour is well well worth joining, we were lucky to share the wealth of knowledge of a Nyonya, Ms Janice Oh."
Roger O,20,Apr 2015,NA,40,Worth visiting,"Made a visit to learn more about Peranakan culture and perhaps establish how much of my multi-ethnic background might be connected to it. <br/><br/>Certainly a fascinating insight into how Peranakan people lived but disappointed that, after the initial introduction describing the intermarriage between Malays, Chinese, Indian and Eurasian, that what followed was all about the Chinese related way of life.<br/><br/>Interesting, but left feeling the other cultural inter-relationships had been ignored."
Poshberries,150,Apr 2015,NA,50,Highly recommended attraction for tourists and Singaporeans just like me!,This place is a must go for all. Great museum with lots of vintage stuffs to look at. Proud to be a Singaporean with a museum of such to show what we are made of! Take your time and go with your loved ones or family members! It is a truly worthwhile trip i must confess. I was totally blown away with the decor and the arrangement of the settings and setup they have. And not forgetting to thank the pioneers and contributors who made this museum exceptionally memorable. My hubby and I have a great time there and explored more things than what we heard since kids. The Peranakans have excellent sewing skills and exhibit amazing colors for their culture. The best part of them which is similar to most chinese is their piety and chinese traditions. Truly respectable. Will love to visit the place again and when I have kids. This is a place not to be missed for kids to learn more of our ancestors and their unique cultures. Thumbs up!!
eighty7,19,Apr 2015,NA,20,Many exhibits were in bad condition,"Paid $6 each adult only to be disappointed by the many interactive exhibits that were out of order. When we asked one of the staff we were told, ""It's spoilt. Sorry ho."" <br/><br/>Being a Peranakan it saddens me to see that such important part of our history gets a lack of attention."
Boyo T,22,Apr 2015,April 2015,40,Cultural history of Singapore,"Worth a visit for an understanding of an interesting cultural group!! A pre-existing interest would make some aspects more attractive, nonetheless worthwhile! Only a small entry fee."
TrixiesTravel1612,58,Apr 2015,NA,50,A surprising gem!,"We just happened to hear about this place on Trip Advisor and thought we'd  give it a crack.<br/><br/>This was one of the most interesting museums I have ever been to. I had never heard of Peranakan before this museum.<br/><br/>We joined one of the free tours. It was informative and the guide very knowledgeable about Peranakan culture and able to answer questions we had.  <br/><br/>Seriously recommend this museum if you're  looking for something to do. <br/><br/>Bonus: Statue of stray cat that used to hang around the building, out the front."
Gabrielle426,20,Apr 2015,April 2015,50,A Great Cultural Insight,"Brilliant! Make time and don't rush, it is very interesting. The museum is well set up and organised and they do have 'hands on' for the kids."

We were fortunate in that we got there around 10:45 a.m. and a tour in English started at 11:00 a.m.  The guide was extremely knowledgeable and very engaged in answering all her questions.

Schlepper1939,638,Mar 2015,March 2015,50,More to see than you can absorb in one visit,"Singapore is rich in history and culture and this museum is an excellent way to at least scratch the surface of both. You can spend as much or as little time there as you choose but either way, do it.<br/>It was a pleasure to stroll from gallery to gallery at our own pace and just take in the utter splendour and without great hordes of people pushing and shoving.<br/>The resourcefulness and creativeness of the early settlers is inspirational."

cravingescape,772,Mar 2015,March 2015,50,My favourite Singapore Museum,"I really like this friendly place.  I like that you get to experience the culture in this way.  Love the portraits in Gallery 1, love the wedding and funeral exhibits, even the kitchen!  They cater to kids with touch and feel boxes and a stamp hunt on the way, as well as getting to listen on old phones etc.  Not a history museum, but more about the people and culture."
Goin2doit,42,Mar 2015,March 2015,40,Not to be missed,"A well presented background to the Peranakans and their customs, culture and lives.  Some of the information is repeated within the exhibits, otherwise the labelling is good.  Slightly distracting to have groups of tourists rushing around taking photos or listening to tour guides."
Judith A,485,Mar 2015,January 2015,40,A Place to Learn A Lot,"This was a very well organized museum full of wonderful artifacts, many in rooms designed to replicate weddings, dining rooms and the like. the fact that not only Chinese Peranakans, but also Malay and Indian Peranakans were included gave it a feeling of inclusion and completeness I hadn't seen in other similar museums."
JustJay29,160,Mar 2015,December 2014,50,My favourite museum in Singapore,"It's free for the local and if you are not, just pay a small fee and they will give you a sticker (like a pass) there are many information  regards to peranakan culture in Singapore, you can find a lot of antique glass, chinaware and stoneware, some are donated by local Peranakan Family and lot of small items."

Numptyheid,95,Mar 2015,March 2015,50,First rate and fascinating,"This small but brilliantly curated museum provides a fascinating insight into the Peranakan culture with videos, displays and information on every floor. It is thoughtfully laid out in sections depicting every stage of Peranakan life- marriage, birth, life, death, religion etc which makes it easy to follow and appreciate. I highly recommend seeing this museum along side the Baba House on Neil Rd which is a restored Peranakan House and affords the opportunity to see many of the items you'll see in the museum in situ at the house."
David B,224,Mar 2015,January 2015,40,Defines what Peranakan is all about,"This is a nice museum located just a few blocks from the Asian Civilisations museum.  It's a small museum but good.  You'll enjoy the furniture, costumes, portraits, etc."
Deogracias M,133,Mar 2015,February 2015,40,A lot of gold in those wedding jewelries..,First time in the Peranakan museum .. indeed an eye- opener on the opulent lifestyle of these families reflected on those gold jewelries worn at weddings. Drop by the gift shop for wonderful souvenirs.
soujo,107,Mar 2015,March 2015,50,Well worth a visit,"Housed in the Old Tao Nan School building (1912) at Armenian Street, the Peranakan Museum specialises in Peranakan culture. The term 'peranakan' refers to decendents of foreign traders in Southeast Asia who married and fathered children with local women. <br/><br/>It has interesting exhibits on various aspects of life: marriage, death, religion, dress and food. The items on display really brings the rich and colourful Peranakan culture to life. The workmanship of the ceramics, textiles, embroidery and furniture is really impressive.<br/><br/>The building itself is quaint and pretty. The museum is open till 7pm, which makes it easy to plan your visit."
JM49,494,Mar 2015,February 2015,50,Eye-opening,"The thing you go for is the floor dedicated to Peranakan weddings - elaborate, expensive, lengthy, packed full of status-anxiety. Rich families who owned all the necessary trappings made a nice sideline in renting them out to poorer families. A fascinating glimpse into the lives of Chinese men who married Malay women and whose families have contributed hugely to the Singaporean mix."
diouno,39,Mar 2015,January 2015,50,A must visit while in Singapore,"Since the Paranakans played a seminal role in Singapore's history, a visit to this delightful museum is a must for anyone who want to truly understand Singapore's history, culture and even its food.

mykepyke,48,Mar 2015,February 2015,50,Fascinating,A great museum in a beautiful old building (it used to be a Chinese school). Lots of fascinating history about the Peranakan people.
Yorkriver,216,Mar 2015,February 2015,50,An exceptional experience of local culture,"I'd never heard of this place until I did a little research.  I like local culture, so I thouht this might be interesting.<br/>I found it so much more than just interesting--it was fascinating!<br/>A local peranakan guided our tour and I enjoyed every minute of it.  The history and culture of Singapore was brought to life through this slice of Singapore ethnic group."
masatoshis2015,15,Mar 2015,March 2015,50,Good knowledge,I learnt a lot of peranakan people roots here.  It was really good experience.  $6 is worth.
Vic Mayor,"1,652",Mar 2015,NA,50,A Must Visit!,"The Peranakan Museum should never be missed! It is a beautiful museum. The exhibits are just fantastic. <br/><br/>I went here during CNY and admission was free. If you want to go Museum hopping without spending on Admission fees, go to Singapore on CNY."
Rumpuss,114,Feb 2015,February 2015,50,Fascinating view of Singaporeans,Lovely old house filled with the life of the Peranakan people from birth to death and everything in between. Especially good the 2 talking pictures of mother and father explaining their lives together.
Valerie T,82,Feb 2015,February 2015,50,A Culture Comes to Life,"My visit to this museum was the highlight of my trip to Singapore.  Having binge watched the entire series of ""The Little Nyonya"" right before my trip, it was amazing to experience such a well organized display of cultural artifacts and activities of daily life.  We enjoyed a free and informative tour by a Peranakan volunteer who was passionate and proud of her heritage.  Stop into the True Blue Pantry on site for a satisfying cup of red date tea!"
cjb43,117,Feb 2015,January 2015,50,A must visit for anyone who loves history,This is a gem of a museum. It features information that was entirely new to my husband and I especially about the diverse group of people who founded Singapore. All the displays and information were excellently presented.  It made a lasting impression on us.
49bandicoot,57,Feb 2015,February 2015,50,Interesting history from 900AD,A very interesting and well displayed history of the early melting pot that is Singapore. The museum is situated in a well maintained older building over 3 floors. Well done curators. $6 entry well spent.
emhuber51,4,Feb 2015,February 2015,50,An Eyeopener,"The Peranakan Museum is no ordinary museum but one that opens one's eyes to a culture that can only be found in this part of the world.  Very distinctive and rich in their cultural heritage and till this day, the Peranakan People are so proud of their rich heritage and contribution to the Singapore Society.  I strongly recommend a whole day's visit to this museum and one will surely understand this people group from their history to their dressing and food splendour."
Jean Pierre L,5,Feb 2015,August 2014,40,a glimpse in the interesting past,"Very interesting visit, conveniently located with a lot to learn about the life of old local family. Worth a two hours visit"
Tom O.,211,Feb 2015,February 2015,40,Very Informative,"Don't bother with the free guided tour, it's much better to go at your own pace. Got a good feel for how the many cultures came together here."
Lynneheggie,3,Feb 2015,February 2015,50,Lovely museum,"A lovely museum, we enjoyed learning about the Peranakan people and seeing the beautiful furniture, artefacts and clothes. Recommend seeing it, it's quite small so only takes an hour or so to see around."
forensicsgirl,"1,726",Feb 2015,February 2015,40,Glimpse into Singapore's fascinating culture,"Knowing absolutely nothing about Peranakan culture, I visited the museum after reading the positive TA reviews.  The museum is well organized.  The exhibits offer a glimpse into this fascinating culture.  There are a few interactive exhibits.  I especially enjoyed the textiles, jewelry, and furniture."
tlwmd,286,Feb 2015,February 2015,40,Helpful background to Singapore,"My being from the other side of the planet, inevitably I was starting way back in my general knowledge of the background to Singapore, but none the less this museum provided a lot of useful cultural information on the current Singaporean citizens and I felt I was able to learn and appreciate a lot more of this amazing country from the experience. The photos by Ang showing different ethnic backgrounds were particularly amazing and the visit almost worth it just for that."
Singap0re74,5,Feb 2015,February 2015,40,very informative,Lovely welcome.  Exhibits well laid out in this cool building.  I love the way Singaporeans celebrate their diversity. Very helpful in understanding the positive mix that makes up Singapore
Barnowl,39,Feb 2015,NA,40,Beautiful heritage,So much of Singapore is modern and hi-tech it was great to see some of the real distinctive heritage of old Singapore. This museum is all about the truly local culture rather than the British colonials - fascinating and a good conversion of an historic building.
rtl2,464,Feb 2015,July 2014,50,Very Interesting,"As a European, it was fascinating to spend some time in this museum and learn a culture I previously knew nothing about. I spent far longer here than I had been expecting. Well worth the visit."
jill a,41,Feb 2015,February 2015,40,peranakan culture museum,"The Peranakan Museum is a museum in Singapore specialising in Peranakan culture. A sister museum to the Asian Civilizations Museum, it is the first of its kind in the world,so this is a great place to have a stop if you are interested at peranakan culture"
Geraldine L,58,Feb 2015,January 2015,50,Open your eyes,This museum really tells of a 'fifth' race in Singapore. Listen closely and you will hear that the Peranakans did not consider themselves Malay or Chinese.
TakeYourBreathAway,57,Feb 2015,February 2015,50,Inspiring,"Terrific that mixing races is honored and virtue extolled.  Loved the settings, truly explained for all ages"
Leinani L,12,Jan 2015,January 2015,10,A slice of life,"Situated in a mansion, this look at life at the top of the Peranakan lifestyle was engrossing. From birth to death, along with a lot of beautiful dishes, we saw how the Peranakans dealt with their part of the Singaporean world. An historic group, for sure. Lei"
vancouvermtv,307,Jan 2015,January 2015,40,Enjoyed the household items,"A good place to get an overview of the movement of people into and around the Singapore  area and the straits of Mallacca .The clothing, dishes and furniture form the past were in excellent condition. You could get a sense of how the upper class lived. My favourite comment was that parents gave their daughters lots of wedding furniture and gifts since they could not inherit anything. All went to the sons of course."
Jeffrey C,490,Jan 2015,January 2015,50,Discover a fascinating heritage at this museum,"The Peranakan Museum was well worth a leisurely visit. It is a discovery of a rich cultural heritage of a diverse history of the Straits settlement areas in SEAsia. While it is not a huge museum, it houses a fascinating array of antique collection of most aspects of the Nonya and Baba life - wedding, religious beliefs, cooking, language, public life and funeral. These are displayed artfully through formal and informal dress, jewellery, crockery, furniture, altars, textile, cookware, etc. the museum is spacious and airy, and lovely atrium. Staff were friendly and helpful. The museum shop while rather small is worth a visit. Nice to visit...again!"
Pigkiller,230,Jan 2015,May 2014,10,Peranakan does not mean Biologically-Mixed.,"To the reviewer from Quezon City below who said Peranakan = mixed Chinese and Malay, this is factually WRONG. Peranakan means Straits Chinese people who were early settlers from China to Malaya and who adopted certain aspects of the culture such as cooking and clothes.<br/><br/>Most Straits Chinese during the day did not mix with Malays in marriage. The Peranakan culture also does not apply to most Chinese in Singapore and Malaysia. Why? 9.9 in 10 Chinese in Singapore and Malaysia are second-third generation latecomers who came after the Malaya became a British colony which was very late, way after the Peranakans exist. <br/><br/>The Peranakan people were here between 15th to 17th century (1600s). To qualify as a Peranakan, you must be a Chinese person whose Chinese ancestors were in Malaya that early. As you all may understand by now, Malaya was a huge sleepy fishing and farming village until the British colonized it in 1819. After the British colonization, millions of Chinese from Southern China were invited by the colonial government to establish these newly found land, and these Chinese immigrants flooded the key cities of the Straits Settlement - Singapore, Penang and Melaka to make a living. The Chinese in Penang and Melaka grew to become the economic elites of Malaysia and went out to found the capital today, Kuala Lumpur. <br/><br/>Because the largest wave of immigration came from the newcomers, the newcomers engulfed and weeded out the Peranakans, both biologically and culturally. The number of Peranakans was minute before, and after the Brits opened up Malaya, causing the huge avalanche of Chinese to establish both countries (Malaysia and Singapore), the Peranakans were absorbed and vanished into the much larger waves of late Chinese immigrants.<br/><br/>People who self-identify as Peranakans number less than 1% of Chinese Singaporeans and the culture is not longer practiced, leading social scientists to say that it is close to complete extinction."
JAPN,51,Jan 2015,January 2015,50,Well planned and interactve museum to give us a glimpse into a different world.,The kids enjoyed this despite being sick of seeing stuff with us in the heat! Inside was wonderfully cool. The building and layout was beautiful and much thought was put into it.<br/><br/>Lots of interactive stations which we all enjoyed. Would have liked more detail into what the food was - lot of local names which meant nothing to us....this is the only minor criticism in an otherwise engaging morning.
Ali_Hawkins,"2,124",Jan 2015,January 2015,40,Beautiful building,"This is a great museum and the building itself is lovely. There's a cute statue of a Man and Boy outside, showing how exciting it is to see the museum, it's really worth a visit and easy to get to on Armenia Street."
Wendell D,708,Jan 2015,November 2014,40,Nice introduction to Singapore and Malaysian culture.,A manager at the front desk of our hotel recommended that we visit the Peranakan Museum. Turned out to be an interesting introduction to Singapore and Malaysian culture and helpful background for our visit to Melaka.
Joshua Y,22,Jan 2015,December 2014,50,"Great place to visit for non-locals, Chinese","Peranakan = mixed ancestry (Chinese and Malay, Chinese and Javan, etc)<br/>Small cozy museum w 3 floors<br/>Peranakan culture evolved separately from culture of mainland Chinese. It was interesting to note the differences between these. <br/>New exhibit on Peranakan auspicious designs is a must see - the works had integrated Chinese folklore and local myths to come up with a very unique flavor."
Sandy H,399,Jan 2015,January 2015,40,Interesting history - especially wedding traditions,Entrance is always free for Singaporeans and PRs but also for tourists and others on public holidays. Displays were all quite interesting: especially since it was our first visit having lived in Singapore for just over a year and this gave us a better insight into the Straits Chinese and early influence of this culture. I especially liked the section on the wedding traditions. Set in a beautiful building over 3 floors.
Debbie K,"9,787",Dec 2014,December 2014,40,Interesting and Informative Museum,"This is a very interesting museum that deals with the intricacies of a rather unique culture. The terminology in general refers to the culture that has developed among the Straits Chinese. It is an interesting look at the creole nature of the Chinese settlers whose practices and customs evolved from a mixture of influences from their native China and their adopted Malay homeland, as well as the additional significant effect of the British colonial culture. While the term Peranakan generally refers to the Straits Chinese, the museum is careful to acknowledge the fact that there are Peranakan Arab, Indian and Eurasian peoples who fall under this broader cultural umbrella as well. But from what I could tell, the museum focuses mainly on the Peranakan Chinese, which seems by far and away to be the largest subgroup.<br/><br/>The building itself was striking as it is the former Tao Nan School in 1912. Its design was eclectic with stylish columns. The interior was also lovely with elegant features and a nice staircase.<br/><br/>The museum focuses on the everyday life of the Peranakan people, which is really the detailed existence that makes their culture the unique blend that it is. The first floor has a nice display featuring several people who were interviewed to give their statement on what it means to be Peranakan. This exercise in verbalization of self-identity was intriguing.<br/><br/>On the second level, most of the displays had to do with Peranakan weddings, Peranakan food, Peranakan religion and Peranakan funerals. These were all interesting. Weddings were the subject of the better part of the displays and some of the practices were pretty interesting. The one that I recall was the preparation of the wedding bed with a fertility ceremony of having the young page boy roll over and back on the bed three times.<br/><br/>There was also a special display of Peranakan altar cloths. The designs on the various cloths were beautiful. It was an enjoyable exhibit.<br/><br/>This museum provides a great glimpse into the lives of the people in this unique culture. Tracing the history and evolution of the practices from the Colonial times to the present day is fascinating. It provides insight into the current Singaporean culture and thus leads to a useful understanding of the today's Peranakan people. The $6 SGD admission is well worth it."
"Chris J ""Mohawk"" Reed",916,Dec 2014,December 2014,30,great background of Singapore,"Depending upon how you like your museums this is fine if predictable. Lots to see and read on lots of floors about the Peranakan culture and the history of Singapore.<br/><br/>It's very safe, no new exhibitions to spice things or interactive elements.<br/><br/>One to tick off your list though,"
KGB777,"38,048",Dec 2014,NA,40,Interesting exhibits,Came here with our 4 year old daughter for a quick visit. Entrance is free for Singaporeans and PRs so that's a bonus. Displays were all quite interesting: especially since it was my first visit having lived for many years in Singapore. Not too much to keep young children entertained though.
Cheeps21,367,Dec 2014,October 2014,40,cozy museum,Great place to visit and learn about Peranakan culture from the displays and artefacts. There is small homely cafe on the side of the museum.
2011Traveler7,71,Dec 2014,December 2014,40,Singapore Melting Pot,"China, India, Malay, Indonesia with a sprinkling of European salt make for a tasty cultural mix.  <br/><br/>Focusing on the Chinese of Singapore, I leared how this community became seasoned with elements from other cultures.  Glad I took the docent led tour having the exhibits explained in greater detail.<br/><br/>This was my favorite museum in Singapore."
jmkf98,90,Dec 2014,December 2014,30,Could use more lively exhibits,"The exhibits were too staid and lifeless. The Peranakan culture is all about life, colour, music, and food, and we need to see more of that at the museum. Bring in the ""live"" Peranakan in the country to share their stories , have more interactive exhibitions."
Gilliantomlinson,169,Nov 2014,November 2014,40,Good museum but limited subject,"Interesting insight into the Peranakan culture - I learnt who they are and how they live.  Some nice displays of typical houses, clothing, weddings etc.   It is a good way to spend a rainy afternoon, but by it's nature the subject matter is limited."
Vivnoname,153,Nov 2014,November 2014,50,Heaven,"The most incredible porcelain, textiles, jewellery, furniture, clothing, accessories and everything in between are stored in this beautiful old school building. I had found out a little about the Peranakan culture before I went to the museum but nothing prepared me for the treasures I found inside. I had even visited the Asian Civilisations museum where there was a Peranakan exhibition. I couldn't help but gasp or shake my head in wonder at the intricacy of the work and detail that is so much a part of this culture. I couldn't get enough of it and was on the floor trying to capture the fine detail of the furniture when a woman (unfortunately I can't remember her name) told me how happy she was that I appreciated it so much. She then told me she would be starting the Peranakan tour in 10 minutes and would I like to join her. Her tour was so informative and delivered with warmth and humour, it was fascinating. The vibrant colours, the incredible, minute detail of the craftsmanship and the time that went into the making of these works of art was mind blowing for me. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven when I saw the wedding bed, and the beadwork was like nothing I've ever seen. It is a definite 'must see' if you're travelling to Singapore and only $6 Singapore dollars for entry, the tour was free. Josephine in the gift shop was wonderful and a delight to talk to. I will definitely be back for more."
Ian2653,7,Nov 2014,November 2014,50,Peranakan Museum,A must see to understand traditional Singaporean culture and Nonya food. A relaxing respite from the heat and shopping :) The souvenir store is run by a gem of a lady. Well worth a visit :)
CuritibaHostel,1,Nov 2014,December 2013,50,Good to learn a bit about Peranakan culture,"It was a nice visit at the museum, specially because I was able to join a guided tour for free in Portuguese.. heheeh I super recommend a visit at the museum, specially during the Singapore Night Festival."
Annie,517,Nov 2014,November 2014,40,Our last day in Singas,We went with a friend who hadn't been here either. Well organised and the displays were beautiful. Certainly gave you the history of the Peranakan which was lovley.Also had an elevator which accommadated those who have trouble with stairs.
arcmb,31,Nov 2014,September 2014,40,Learn about local culture,"Singapore is fascinating and we wanted to learn more about local culture. The Peranakan Museum was great for us: it is not too extensive and it is informative. Do try to have a guided tour. Our guide (they are all volunteers) was very informative and gave clear answers to our questions. She was a very nice person and just made our tour an enjoyable experience. The exhibits are real masterpieces, worth seeing even if they wouldn't be accompanied by any explanation. Even though it is not a big museum, we learned a lot about the provenience and culture of local people. A real discovery for Europocentric visitors."
UnabashedFoodie,90,Nov 2014,November 2014,50,Peranakan,"Charming museum showcasing Peranakan culture, history and art. Perankans are Chinese immigrants who married native people predominantly in Singapore and Malaysia."
spocksf,84,Nov 2014,November 2014,50,Must see museum!,"If you really want to get to know more about Singapore's cultural heritage, this museum is a must. The content is really interesting and well put-together.  If you have limited time in Singapore, make sure this is on your itinerary."
Selkirk052,48,Nov 2014,November 2014,40,Great exhibition and building,The Peranakan Museum is well worth a visit. It demonstrated the immigration of Chinese and Indians to the peninsular and shows their integration and development as traders. Loved it.
bikerwoo,113,Oct 2014,October 2014,50,Interestingly Educational,"In order to understand the history and culture of the Peranakan People of Singapore, a visit to the Peranakan Museum is a must.  The displays, videos and placards depicts a chronological history of how the Peranakens came to be in Singapore.  Additionally, how it's culture was developed from a myriad of different countries and their cultures.<br/><br/>If anyone ever visits Singapore, I recommend a tour of this attraction be on their must see list."
HoustonCouchPotatoes,89,Oct 2014,October 2014,40,Gem!,"We liked this museum.  We took a free docent-led tour, and it was well worth it.  We learned a lot about culture and daily life that we otherwise would have missed.  The scale of the museum is much smaller and more intimate than the Asian Civilizations Museum, and the knowledge we gained was more about daily life.  We highly recommend."
novart13,"1,025",Oct 2014,September 2014,30,Quiet place in the city,"Free tickets to the Peranakan Museum we have received at the hotel. Museum is a three storey building, but it seems to be rather small. We were there an hour before closing and we were the only guests. You can find there a history of Peranakan civilization in Asia. The biggest attraction for children probably will be collecting special stamps."
esprit8814,116,Oct 2014,September 2014,40,Good museum,"This is a neat musuem which has about 3-4 storeys of different sections of the Peranakan areas such as weddings, religion, textiles and much more. It's quite informative and definitely an eye-opener. Definitely recommend this for anyone who is visiting Singapore &amp; interested in getting to know the locals and history abit more."
Seattle_Traveler,194,Oct 2014,September 2014,40,Informative,"We did not know anything about the Peranakan's so found this to be a worthwhile stop. The museum only takes about an hour to tour. Pretty building. Not a ""must see"" but certainly worth a stop it time allows."
Kat H,135,Oct 2014,October 2014,50,Historical Art at its best,"Fascinating museum. A well planned museum, as it breaks the different galleries down into specific subjects. From basic explanation of 'Peranakan' origins, to Weddings, Religion, Fashion, feasting and much more! Amazing artefacts, which are so well preserved.<br/>I was truly amazed by the Auspicious Designs exhibition. This was a display of vibrant Batik Altar Cloths. The quality of cloth on display was astounding, when you consider that they would all have been handmade, and also how long ago they were made. Printing, embroidery, beading. Brilliant!<br/>Loved this museum!<br/>Allow a couple of hours. $6."
Dublin2010-16,58,Sep 2014,August 2014,50,Beautiful,"For those textile and decorative art lovers out there, make sure you visit the museum.  I found it delightful in both the displays and in the ambience. Very informative."
PhillipaandGeoff,203,Sep 2014,April 2014,40,fascinating insight into the Peranakan culture,This is worth a visit - you only need a couple of hours. The collection gives you a window into another culture - look out for the wonderfully fine beaded embroidery.
Shannon D,89,Sep 2014,NA,50,Something interesting and unique ,Loved this museum! Everything is so well presented and the detailed artefacts are magnificent! This was my first trip to Singapore and I stumbled upon this museum- and it turned out to be my favourite! A fascinating insight into the mixed race culture in Singapore!
DeeNumber4,19,Sep 2014,September 2014,50,History Buffs,"The Peranakan Museum is in the heart of Singapore.  It is a great first museum if you know nothing of the Peranakan people in South East Asia.  Rather than give you a detailed history, the museum is arranged to introduce the most significant characteristics of the culture including wedding rituals, traditional family roles, and craft works commonly produced by Peranakan women.  If you are only in Singapore for a short time and are staying close to the Central Business District, I recommend this Museum.  If possible, be sure to arrange for one of the museum's docents to give you a tour."
Visa711,489,Sep 2014,August 2014,50,unique musuem,"We travel a lot so I tend to like to find unique museums as some of them like the major art and natural history museums tend to blend together after you have seen some of them!  This was a very interesting museum about the Peranakan, something I had never even heard of until I went to Singapore.  I highly recommend taking one of the guided tours.  The tour guide was able to interpret so much more than we would have gleaned out of looking at everything on our own."
BillyJane_C,122,Sep 2014,August 2014,50,Great museum to learn a bit about history,"Beautiful exhibition pieces, well organized in 10 galleries, covering all aspects of Peranakan life.<br/>There's a bit of a search game to keep young ones interested. <br/><br/>Amazing batiks, furniture, interesting stories.<br/><br/>Guess it can save you a trip to Mallaca. Well worth a visit."
KFP57,97,Aug 2014,April 2014,50,Amazing History,"This place was well worth the look, it's a Museum full of History and a Lifestyle that tells its own story, Furniture and Fabric Pieces are beautiful, staff were very helpful and happy to talk about anything you wanted to know more about. Cost to enter was minimal."
SilverLining88,31,Aug 2014,June 2014,50,History of the Nonya Baba,"This lovely building was formerly a school and is located in Armenian Street. Inside you will find a showcase of artefacts and wares which bring you back to a bygone era.<br/><br/>There are 3 levels and 10 galleries. Level 1 begins with the origins of the Peranankan people and their culture which depicts a traditional wedding that lasts over a period of 12 days!<br/><br/>On level 2 in gallery 6 titled Nonya, you will find beautiful beadwork on shoes and clothes known as a kebaya as worn by the women.<br/><br/>In gallery 9 you will find a superb collection of Nonya porcelain.<br/><br/>This museum is worth a visit. It is a lovely heritage building and a great way of browsing without the usual hustle and bustle and you also get a chance to keep cool whilst learning about the Peranakans."
penangnite,"1,421",Aug 2014,August 2014,50,Really excellent museum on the peranakan culture. Superb,"For visitors to Singapore, this should be a must see as it highlights a very important but probably not the most well known aspect of Singapore culture - the Peranakans.<br/><br/>In summary, the Peranakans refers to the Chinese living in the Straits Settlement States of Melacca, Penang and Singapore.  You can definitely see the influence of the local malay culture within the dresses and food while aspects of Chinese influence can be prominently observed in the potteries and traditions.<br/><br/>You will be surprise at the differences to what you think you know of Chinese culture and the differences are well exhibited in this lovely museum.  You will see everyday objects used by the Peranakans - clothes, table settings, praying altars as well as the layout of events such as marriage and death. <br/><br/>I would definitely like to see more of what Peranakan food is like and a café specialising in that within the museum would be a plus.<br/><br/>The museum is well curated and located within a short walk from City Hall MRT.  I would recommend for all."
Zalsapehuh,185,Aug 2014,August 2014,40,"Purely Peranakan, not something you see daily","Everything Peranakan here - something we want to know of  that have existed here for centuries!

1958_28,122,Aug 2014,August 2014,30,VISIT TO PERANAKAN MUSEUM IN SINGAPORE,"First time visiting this place and it was seated on a quiet street. The building itself is a heritage and well maintained. It was a 3 storey building. We were greeted with very friendly elderly customer service officers and always smiling.. We were told that there will be tour guides but we decided to explore on our own.  <br/>The first section was the peranakan baju which means the clothes they put on with a nyonya favour. Then we saw more embroidery silk cloth, bed sheets and pillow cases with very fine sewing skills. Next we saw a very old traditional kitchen with olden grinders and cutting boards. The best section which I like was the setting dinner table, full of beautiful painted peranakan plates, saucers and bowls. So historical and memorable. Will recommend friends to visit this place definitely. Please note that for Sngaporeans is free of charge but foreigners will be charged S$6/- per person."
MelbourneKaz,109,Aug 2014,July 2014,50,Beautiful Building and Interesting Exhibits,"The Peranakan museum was in a charming street and we  were fascinated by the museum displays covering different aspects of Peranakan life - marriage, food, death etc. It was good to get away from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd and learn a bit about the history and culture of the area. Recommended."
LussyV,925,Aug 2014,August 2014,30,Peranakan Museum,Nice ethnographic exposition. A lovely place to spend an hour. You have to gather some stamps on a special paper - a nice way to make children (and adults) look carefully!Not expensive admission.
Colin  C,48,Aug 2014,August 2014,50,Nicely presented Museum,"Second visit to this Museum the last visit being 4 years ago, it's had an upgrade since then, the museum has guided tours or you can just wander around, we would recommend a guided tour, our tour guide was Janice, she was very knowledgable and made the museum trip more interesting and informative.<br/>The museum offers a great insight into the Peranakan culture and history with an interesting display of artefacts, some quite valuable and rare, worth a visit if you are interested in the history and culture of this region.<br/>Visit the True Blue Pantry on the ground floor in front of the museum and try a genuine Laksa or one of the many snacks they offer, it 's only a small place but their Laksa was the best we have had in Singapore."

The old house that accommodates the museum is already a heritage in itself."
Linda W,340,Jul 2014,July 2014,40,A little gem,The museum is not very big but very interesting and well worth an hour or so of your time. Provides an insight into an interesting aspect of Singapore history.
VeroniqueM68,118,Jun 2014,June 2014,50,Perfect Peranakan history,"Great museum - variety of display styles - video, interactive for children, free tour, cheap entry.<br/>This was my second visit and I will be happy to return for a third - there is so much information here."
AgentM99,341,Jun 2014,June 2014,50,Recommended dose of culture,After doing a lot of touristy non cultural things I was craving some culture - this was perfect.  It's a charming little museum that packs in a lot and is a good way to spend a couple of hours inside from the heat.
Grant M,91,Jun 2014,NA,50,Unique and fascinating,"This museum focuses on a niche of singapores history and culture - that of Chinese merchants coming down into the Malay peninsula, marrying Malay women and a unique and interest culture that grew out of this. The museum is very well laid out and easy to follow. Gorgeous items are on display including furniture, jewelry, clothing etc."
CurlyTraveller,210,Jun 2014,March 2014,50,Charming museum,"I have visited only once and left with the feeling that I had to go back at least once more, since I did not take enough time to see everything.<br/><br/>The Peranakan heritage and history is a very specific and beautiful one. They had a delicate taste in decorations, fashion and furniture.<br/><br/>Interesting!"
wingate,"2,241",May 2014,May 2014,40,informative,Found this when I went to the national museum.well laid out and informative it tells you about aspects of Singaporean society you would otherwise unaware of.certainly worth a visit.
Ronald B,182,May 2014,May 2014,50,must see,This small museum is a delight.  The Peranakans were a very integral part of Singapore's culture and history. It was extremely interesting to learn their culture and manners.  Give yourself one and half to two hours to visit.
dynamic14,"10,088",May 2014,May 2014,50,Informative and educational,"We were not intending to visit the Peranakan Museum but since we were at Stamford Court less than 5 minutes away, it was highly recommended that we pay a visit especially since we had some time to spare.<br/><br/>Admission fee for Singaporeans and PR is free.  So there is no reason for a local not to visit at least once to learn about the rich Peranakan culture.  Please bring your ID for free entry.  Besides that, the entrance fee ranges from $1.50 - $6.<br/><br/>There are some interactive exhibits which made the visit even more interesting.  <br/><br/>Imagine a wedding lasting for 12 days! Take a peek into a wedding chamber.  Listen to recordings of the peranakan language.  Learn about the colourful nyonyaware porcelain."
AngusMRobinson,359,May 2014,May 2014,50,"Essential Cultural Experience, Singapore","To gain a better informed insight about the culture heritage of Singapore, a visit to this small, but very good quality museum is recommended. Located very close to downtown Singapore hotels, this attraction is an ideal place to fill in an hour or two, and with a very reasonable entry fee."
Tessaho,141,May 2014,May 2014,50,A little historical gem well worth a visit,"This intimate sized museum is located in one of the first schools set up for the education of Chinese children and is conveniently located within walking distance from Marina Bay and Raffles areas. It's exhibits trace the origins and stories of the Chinese, Indian and Malay peoples who intermarried: in the process revealing much of Singapore's history as a centre of commerce and migration. A lovely way of seeing the very personal stories of Singaporean peranakans and their unique heritage."
Jill_and_Steve_Corv,112,May 2014,April 2014,40,Insights some Singaporeans don't know,I enjoyed this museum very much - many great insights into early Singapore history which turned out to be good conversation starters with the Singaporeans we met up with!
Eva-Lucia L,21,Apr 2014,April 2014,30,Good but lacks some variety,"A good one to tack onto the other museums in the area and a nice intro to better sites such as Baba house, the Peranakan museum is an interesting place to visit if not a little heavy on the detail relating to the marriage ceremony. <br/><br/>Not even sure what the proportion of Singaporean culture is Peranakan although perhaps I wasn't paying close enough attention.<br/><br/>A worthwhile detour but not not a 'must-see'."
Lim,119,Apr 2014,NA,50,Interesting and well informed,"I did not plan for this visit and I happened to walk past here.  As Singaporean is free to visit museums, I decided to go in and take a look.  It is definitely worth the visit with many old items to see, all interesting."
Christina P,105,Apr 2014,July 2013,40,recommended,I and my friend come to see the museum and find out many interesting exhibited. many of my friends even don't notice that they have this museum here. i love them though.
Jack K,3,Apr 2014,March 2014,50,educational and well worth the time,"My friend and I planned an hour at this museum, but we ended up spending the whole afternoon there as there were so many interesting exhibits and artefacts showcasing the rich culture and heritage of the Peranakan people. <br/><br/>We were impressed with the guided tour and the knowledge of the tour guide there. Highly recommended!"
jackd_10,267,Apr 2014,April 2014,50,Interesting and Informative,"A charming, well organized and very informative museum that documents the history of multiethnic people in this part of the world. Excellent displays of artifacts and supportive information will please any visitor. Well worth a visit."
For_Elsie,87,Mar 2014,March 2014,50,Enlightening,Visited the museum on Sunday 23 March. Not too busy and we managed to join a guided tour which was enlightening. Recommended.
naaley,137,Mar 2014,March 2014,50,Informative,This is one of the museums that I thoroughly enjoyed and went back within 3 months. The artefacts they have are vast and elaborate. Gives you an insight into the culture.
Mandy B,49,Mar 2014,February 2014,50,Local Culture,Good conversion of an older building with a nice airy feel and unusually light for a museum. Very fine collection particularly of textiles and furniture. Great display of Baba kitchen also.
Paul L,699,Mar 2014,November 2013,40,Very interesting,"Went in knowing nothing of Peranakan culture, came out impressed with the colour and diversity of it all. Which has to be  win!<br/><br/>Effectively what this museum is is a celebration of the combination of cultures that has gone on in certain sections of the Singaporean population. The museum takes care to discuss not only the historical aspects of this but also spends a great deal of time on the social side of the equation, celebrations, birth, death and marriage as well as featuring quotes from modern day Peranakan people. It is a vibrant collection.<br/><br/>Easily accessed from the Singapore CBD this museum can be combined with the National Museum and the Singapore Art Museum - take care to get a deal whereby you pay for a ticket that will get you into multiple museums for the one price.<br/><br/>Furthermore this museum is nearby the Civil Defence Heritage Gallery and the Philatelic Museum should either of those interest you."
orangeleaves,10,Mar 2014,January 2014,40,Fascinating insights,"I stumbled across the Peranakan Museum completely by accident, as was pleasantly surprised. I would highly recommend this museum to anyone who is interested in learning more about the people who live in Singapore and their interesting culture history.<br/><br/>The exhibits are arranged into a variety of different Peranakan life stages, including marriage, and host displays of clothes and intricate beaded textiles, among others. My favourite display illustrated how the Peranakan language has changed using different telephones from different eras, that you could listen into staged everyday conversations. It is great to see a museum offering something for different learning styles and interests, and also exhibits that can benefit the visually impaired."
Popeye - The sailor,72,Feb 2014,NA,40,Really interesting,"Peranakans are fusion on malay, chinese and Indians. <br/>We found it really interesting.<br/>Every minute details have been displayed and explained really well.  From the utensils they use till their accessories,  the museum had a very good collection. <br/>Don't miss the audio visuals in the basement."
Kerog,459,Feb 2014,February 2014,50,Interesting museum,"This was an interesting museum showing the culture, history and life of this group in Singapore. The displays are well set out and the signage is very good. To see the embroidery and beaded work was very nice.  For people who want to see how this group lived in Singapore I would recommend this museum. It is easily accessible and easy to wander around."
Youngryman,277,Feb 2014,February 2014,50,A Pleasant and Interesting Surprise,"Putting aside the sheer pleasure of entering any air-conditioned place in Singapore, this was a beautiful presentation of an important ethnic group. The exhibits were cleverly done and some of the crafts were amazing, particularly the glass bead work and embroidery. Entered with only the thought of cooling off and stayed for an interesting hour."
CindyAnn37,529,Feb 2014,February 2014,50,An Insight into the Ethnic background of Singapore,"I really enjoyed our visit to the museum.  The old school building in which it is housed is very elegant and beautiful.  We were recommended to visit it by a resident of Singapore and it was well worth while.  It explains clearly about the affluent merchant society and their culture that has formed on the island. It shows how inter-marriage of different races makes up the people of Singapore of today. It was also interesting to learn it is the only museum of its kind in the world.<br/><br/>It explains briefly about the history of the island and how the different Asian influences have affected life there.  There are some stunning artefacts - some beautiful costumes and pieces of furniture and of course the magnificent bed with the superbly embroidered bed hangings.  I particularly liked the old style Singapore kitchen.  The attendant was very helpful in explaining what some of the objects would have been used for.  <br/><br/>If you would like to learn a little about the island and its people, this museum is for you.  It’s easy to find and there is a taxi stand right outside."
MichaelOttawa_Canada,355,Feb 2014,February 2014,50,Great museum,This is a great place to spend a coupe of hours. Very interesting artifacts and a lot to learn about the Peranakan. Good explanations in all areas of the museum. A must see if you have a couple of days in Singapore
Halkidis,"4,632",Jan 2014,January 2014,40,Our first touch to Peranakan Culture,"To be honest, I didn't expected that much this place, but because our ticket to National Museum was valid here, we decided to go. And actually it was pretty interesting and it was nice to know more of Peranakan Culture. Especially their wedding section is really interesting(for women)"
drwInAvon,79,Jan 2014,January 2014,40,Surprising!,"This museum focuses on one of the cultures in Singaporean society.  It is not a large museum, but covers the breadth of this culture -- clothes, ceramics, weddings, death, and so on.  I had some extra time and stopped in this museum, and I was surprised how well-organized, interesting, and friendly this museum was.  It was a good size -- not large, but enough material to give you a good view of the culture.  There were interesting and unique things to see and learn there.  <br/>If I had 2-3 days in Singapore, I would work this into the list.  Very nice."
travel_with_kids041,73,Jan 2014,January 2014,50,Definitely worth a visit,"This museum was a great find on a recent visit to Singapore. You hear and see the word ""Peranakan"" a lot in Singapore but I'd never really understood what it meant. The museum has plenty of visual displays and artifacts and I found it really informative. It helped me understand a little more about Peranakan culture and answered a few questions I'd had. The museum isn't huge so not overwhelming (I spent just under an hour there), but is definitely worth the effort. The building is also impressive."
milvoon,101,Jan 2014,January 2014,30,Insight into Peranakan culture and traditions,"Here, you'll learn about the history, culture and traditions of the Peranakan - sections in the Museum dedicated to Peranakan history, wedding, food and chinaware, clothes and accessories.<br/><br/>There's limited interaction with visitors though (a few motif stamps, touch and feel stations) - something which definitely can be improved. I was also quite disappointed at the food section - where I did not find any pictures of Peranakan food!<br/><br/>Otherwise, it's good insight to Peranakan culture."
Bikerguysg,380,Jan 2014,December 2013,30,Compact museum of Peranakan history,"I visited this museum as well due to the purchase of the $10 Biennale 2013 ticket. The ticket holder allows the person to visit the national museum of Singapore, Singapore art museum and the peranakan museum. <br/>This compact little museum is well air conditioned so one of the reasons to come visit, is to escape the stifling heat of Singapore haha. Its well displayed and they even have a funeral scene re-enacted.<br/>I have visited Penang Cheong Fatt Tse Mansion and must admit that its a different experience altogether. I didn't visit penang peranakan museum however so I can't compare it..<br/>The museum trys its best in showing the history of peranakan development. However, I find unless you are interested in peranakan history or their customs or development, you can give it a miss. Its like going to England and just focusing on Liverpool or greater Manchester history so its a more of a micro look at things."
Thewilltolive,49,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,Fantastic exhibit,"Want to learn a bit more about the people who brought you laksa, nasi lemak and all those wonderful colourful coconut desserts you see around? Pop into the Peranakan Museum and find out a obit more.<br/><br/>The museum houses a wonderful display of furniture and artifacts and interactive video interviews with local Peranakan, or Nonya, in which they explain aspects of their lives and traditions.<br/><br/>Next door is a small shop called ""True Blue"", selling Peranakan cookies, some crafts and food and drink, and an array of books on the history and crafts of the Peranakan as well as a selection cookbooks written by Peranakan cooks and restauranteurs.<br/><br/>Buy a cookbook and take home the recipes you enjoyed on your holiday. I know I did and will!"
Daveze,44,Dec 2013,January 2013,50,The best Peranakan museum in asia,It is the best because there isn't any other that is as big or showcases the unique peranakan history and culture with the same amount of detail.
mayling c,34,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,Peek into history,Great museum that allows you to peek into time. A lot of interesting facts. Well worth the entrance fee.
Henry F,542,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,An unusual and excellent museum,"My wife and I enjoyed this museum enormously. The building itself is lovely, and the exhibits teach a great deal about the history of the Peranakan culture in Singapore, with everything from fashions to weddings to funerals - all forms of rites and customs are demonstrated. There are a number of informative, relatively brief, messages on computer terminals in various rooms. We thought the museum was a very valuable and enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours in Singapore."
Diannedidi,9,Dec 2013,December 2013,50,Unique Culture and Heritage,"A compact museum that stores a wealth of history, culture believes tradition. <br/><br/>A must visit as it gives a different unique view of the history and people here. The food can still be found in restaurants and shops. I have tried it, I like sweets, they are bit different - sticky sort but delicious. Their savory dishes are good too. <br/><br/>Highly recommended."
JJn132Cole,6,Dec 2013,November 2013,50,Great History,"The museum is set in a quiet off street, in a beautiful building which has local flavour in its architecture.<br/><br/>The collection stretches from daily living from weddings to funeral.  Interesting to join the guided tour to understand the unique culture encompases, from clothing for different occasions, food, jewelry, symbolism etc etc.  <br/><br/>It is a nice compact museum with impact.  All will enjoy the displays."
Fransmortier,57,Dec 2013,November 2013,40,Small museum with nice details,"It gives you a good view on the details of the “Singaporean” people. What is a Peranakan, how did they live, how do they live today … An attractive exhibition in a very nice renovated “old” school.  <br/>Not something I will put into my top 10 list of “to see” but can be #11"
Lisa-khy,2,Nov 2013,NA,50,A unique place,"Guided with a tour have much understanding for the Peranakan history. Growing up in Penang, which is where those Baba &amp; Nyonya settle down. I was very impressed with those master piece that the museum had collected.  Stunning and amazingly!  Must visit."
PandamaniaSGP,94,Nov 2013,September 2013,50,Could be the world's best collection of Peranakan culture,"Having read up extensively on this thin sliver of world history, the visit was made no less enriching  by a docent.  Please sign up for the guided tour, the only way to get the most out of the artefacts on display.  Have lunch at the peranakan restaurant next door.  Then make a second visit to have a closer scrutiny of the beaded work, they are insane.  After you had enough, go to Select Books for a good selection of Asian publications."
WinnieP,137,Nov 2013,October 2013,40,Lovely place to Trace your Roots!,The exhibits are lovely and tells you a lot about the Peranakan Culture and history. You have to see it for yourself.<br/>There is a museum shop and little cafe serving local snacks.<br/>There are also activities held monthly for children where they get to dress up and also do art and craft or read. Check the museum's website for updates!
karhonleong,748,Nov 2013,November 2013,30,All about Peranakans,"The definition of Peranakan, and photos of Peranakans are shown the moment you enter, <br/>In total of 10 galleries of 3 level building.  The building is a former school in the city area.<br/>Exhibitions include wedding, ceremonies, fashion, food and feasting, religions and prominent Peranakans.<br/>In the wedding section, shows the wedding bed, and wedding dresses.<br/>In the Food and Feasting shows the cookware, and tableware used, etc...<br/>There is a section on death, the supernatural and coffins, so parental guidance is required for the kids.<br/>This place is fully air conditioned, so as any other indoor museums in Singapore, <br/>Admission is free for locals. Foreigners and tourists check out website for admission charge details."
Colin C,4,Nov 2013,October 2013,50,Bringingh history alive,"Don't be put off by the word 'museum'. This isn't a stuffy, boring collection of fusty musty stuff. It's alive - and fascinating. Singapore itself is an amazing cultural mix - perhaps most amazing because of the way the cultures do mix. And this small but very accessible museum is living proof. It's located a little 'off the beaten track' but do search it out and go there. As you enter you are confronted with faces - the faces of people who have come to live in Singapore and have made it their new home. You will learn there about their lives and their customs - what they have brought with them from their own cultures and what they miss that they left behind. The museum is interesting, entertaining, and in some ways humbling. If only we could all live together like that."
poyentseng,6,Nov 2013,NA,40,Small but Nice!,I started my day 1 with a walk around Civic District but not until I visted Peranakan Museum that I began to feel interested. The museum is not large in scale but it's dedicated to a culture that makes Singapore special and gave me a good head start of the rest of the tour. Recommend for first stop of the tour.
inja48,126,Nov 2013,November 2013,40,Take guided tour,Suggest this museum is very worth while if you go on a guided tour first.<br/>Entry fee is not expensive and the museum is very well set out in an impressive former school building. The exhibits are well explained in several languages but brought to life by the local guide.<br/>I learnt so much.<br/>Recommend this museum to anyone who has an interest in history.
CaptainCutlazz,46,Oct 2013,November 2012,50,A step back into the history of Singapore.,"I love this museum.  If you want to discover an unknown history, you don't have to come much further to finding documented relics of the Peranakan decent.  Javanese crowns, Balineses jewels, Tamil, Hokkien and Malay wardrobe - all representing the pride of a race of original Singaporeans.  An awesome history of the country and next door serve yourself some genuine Peranakan fare at their restaurant.  Awesome - and something that every visitor should want to discover."
houndy11,158,Oct 2013,October 2013,40,History of Peranakan,"Recently visited the Museum, it houses traditional Peranakan items as per the museum name. Joined a guided tour of the museum (Do check the timing), the guide explanation was good and learn some new stuff. Rather small place but will rate it well."
bruceli_88,92,Oct 2013,September 2013,40,A trip down memory lane ...,"The Peranakan Museum was truly an interesting experience.  Located in the heart of the Lion City, it is a multi-storey building that houses all things Peranakan.  Peranakan is the terms used to described mixed marriages between the Chinese and Malays (during the Straits Settlement days when Chinese immigrants wedded many of the local women).  I was surprised there are many types of Peranakans even to the Indian and Indonesian lineages.  This information is all lined up at the ground floor.<br/><br/>As you move upwards, you will see the various types of items that are perculiar to the Peranakans.  Apart from the usual matrimonial beds, furnitures, clothings, etc, this exhibition also sheds light into the wedding presents being presented to both the groom and bride's family as exchanges.  <br/><br/>There is also sections on Peranakan kitchen, beliefs and funerals ... in that, they are still quiet steep in Chinese traditions, albeit those who embrace the Christian faith.  These kitchen exhibition contains an elaborate collection of Chinese bowls akin to those Ming type of inlaid drawings and shapes, and a replica of the olden day kitchen. Try to find the olden day ""fridge"" high up in the ceiling ... The Peranakan are also well-known for their unique food which is sometimes a mixture of Chinese and Malay put together.  <br/><br/>The other two sections are something unique that you don't get to see much in other Peranakan museums in Penang or Malacca in Malaysia.  Here, there are elaborate prayer hall materials as well as a replica wake of a wealthy Peranakan in the last century.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very interesting museum that will provide you a glimpse of our forefathers who decided to set up their lives in a faraway land called South of the Ocean (or Nanyang in Chinese)."
Erwin K,"1,964",Oct 2013,October 2013,30,History of the Peranakans,"We visited this museum on 14 October 2014.<br/>This Peranakan Museum located at the Armenian street ,and reacheable within walking distance from City Hall MRT station.The Museum acts as a part of the Asian Civilization Museum, explores the culture of Peranakan communities in in Southeast Asia.<br/>It is a 3 storeys building with 9 exhibition galleries.<br/>Enterance fee was SGD 6 per person.Interactive displays of clothing , accessories , wedding bed , beads handicraft , photos , mozaic glass art, pottery ,peranakan kitchen and light show ( timed ) are displayed in this museum.<br/>Try the ancient phones , where you can hear the chit chat of the ancient peranakans.<br/>When we visit this museum , some of the interactive displays cannot work.<br/>Overall , this museum have to add more artifacts to be displayed, so it can add the value of excitement<br/>There's a gift and souvenir shop beside the front gate , prices are a bit expensive , but the quality of the goods sold was quite high."
Michelle V,45,Oct 2013,June 2013,40,Interesting place,"I love the artifacts and traditional items there. It really shows the unity of variety of peranakan in singapore. The place itself is really unique. But we can't take pictures or videos there. There are 2 floors or 3 floors I guess. Each floor has 2 galleries or more. Each gallery had their own theme and topic. In every gallery, you need to collect some kind of stamp.<br/>The museum is located in some kind of european styled street. Around that area is The Singapore Philately museum, Fort Canning, Singapore Art Museum, Fire station museum, and Clark Quay (You need to walk) It's really convenient because you could get to other museums easily"
Derek1999,3,Oct 2013,October 2013,50,Nice place to learn about the Peranakans,"Never knew of Perankans, thus was really glad to have been there on the recommendation of the hostel staff at the Little Red Dot. I think it is a very thought through Museum. Worth the time spent !"
Haki123,20,Oct 2013,June 2013,40,Really interesting,we came there on our last day in SG since we didnt really know what to do. But it turned out a very useful and interesting visit. The museum is not very big but they features things that amazes us about SG traditions.
Viphil M,41,Oct 2013,August 2013,40,A must to appreciate Singapore history,"Organization of the material and its display is excellent and is easy to follow, including for children.  For one to appreciate the history of Singapore, including for many natives too, an unhurried visit is a must; indeed even an additional visit is worth it for that reason.  An amusing highlight is the made-up phone conversation between two women gossiping, which you can hear towards the end of the visit."
Michelle K,63,Oct 2013,July 2013,50,Great place + free for international student,"I came here with my niece (not study in Singapore). The ticket for me was 6SGD, but for my niece it’s free because she brought her student card. It surprised me a lot, and I think it’s a good thing <br/>create such opportunity for all students.<br/><br/>The museum was great, very informative and interesting. It's a good place for youngsters."
RhondaSydney,89,Sep 2013,September 2013,50,Highlight of our visit,Wished we had visited the museum.  It explained a lot about Singapore.  Thank you to Jennifer who was our tour guide who was informative and answered lots of questions.  Well worth a visit

CosmicAngela,232,Sep 2013,January 2013,50,fabulous museum,"have wanted to visit this museum for a long time , fantastic , full of clothing , furniture ceramics well laid out , clearly labelled and great interactive temporary exhibition too. covered history of Straits people , as well as social history and food"
girleen,186,Sep 2013,June 2013,40,Great presentation on the Malay Straits Chinese culture.,"I really enjoyed learning about the Malay Straits Chinese culture - their traditions, furniture, food, weddings, furniture etc. They were often successful merchant families that intermarried and even at some point converted to Christianity. Really interesting slice of history and nicely presented. Eat next door at True Blue cuisine for a taste of their traditional food. Ask to see their gorgeous beaded shoe collection. Amazing!"
DonBosque,116,Sep 2013,September 2013,50,LEARN ABOUT AN UNKNOWN CULTURE,"This small museum, just around the corner from the YMCA, does an excellent job of educating about a little known sub-culture; that of the Malay Straits Chinese.   When the men of traditional southern Chinese trading families began to marry Malay women, something magic happened.    Go and learn about it, and you will learn how it shaped history and led to some new art forms."
AlanDDuncan,147,Sep 2013,September 2013,50,Delightful,"Great collection of beautiful and interesting artefacts from Singapore's history, laid out in nine themed galleries, each highlighting a different aspect of Peranakan culture. An excellent set of exhibits, with the narrative and history of the region brought to life. The emphasis on human stories and the melding of different cultures to form the hybrid Peranakan culture is fascinating and shows how people from diverse backgrounds can not only live together in harmony, but learn and grow together. At $6 entry, great value too."
740Elly48,443,Sep 2013,September 2013,40,History,Found this an excellent museum. We were fortunate enough to arrive in time for a guided tour which certainly further enlightened us on the life styles of the various groups who are Peranakans. The museum is well laid out and well wortth a visit.
JonofWilson,204,Sep 2013,September 2013,40,Interesting,A well laid out museum that gives an interesting history of the Peranakan people as well as their culture. Not far from the chaos of Orchard Rd it is well worth a visit. The tiny but beautiful shop is must before leaving.
Peter C,37,Sep 2013,August 2013,40,Singapore History,"I'm a history buff and spent around 6 hours visiting this place and the National Museum. Entrance to Peranakan is about S$5 and one is left alone to wander around the three floors of this old, but well maintained building. It focuses on life as the original Malay/Chinese lived in a few centuries ago."
Ckeong89,286,Sep 2013,August 2013,50,Good place to learn about Peranakans!,"Peranakans in Singapore were closely related to the development of Singapore and Malaya. So this is a good place not only learning about Peranakans but Singapore history too. This museum displays everything about Peranakans, from the origins, cultures, living style, customs, etc.. Grab a joint ticket to visit both Peranakans Museum and Asian Civilisation Museum at a discounted price. Get a puzzle at the counter and play the simple games during your visit and keep it as a souvenir. Some of the displayed items are provided for the tourists to touch and feel. Unlike the other museum which keep everything behind the glass."
JoForbes,"1,374",Sep 2013,September 2013,40,Visit the Peranakan Museum to learn about Singapore's cultural past,"Although the Peranakan Museum is located in the centre of the city, it is somewhat off the main tourist trail. A small but very interesting and probably one of the most colourful, the museum aims at explaining the rich and diverse  history of the Peranakans. Southeast Asia has long been a crossroads geographical and ethnically, opportunities of trade and commercial wealth has lured travellers here from distant lands. Many made their fortunes and left, but some stayed and put down roots, they married local women whose descendants are called Peranakans. The museum houses one of the world’s best collections of Peranakan objects, be awed by exquisite jewellery, beadwork, textiles, colourful ceramics and ornate furniture.<br/><br/>The museum is open Monday-Sunday 10.00am-7.00pm and Friday 10.00am-9.00pm. Singaporean citizens and PRs are free; otherwise adults are $6.00 and children free. On Friday evenings between 7.00pm-9.00pm there is discounted admission. There are guided tours available, but check the website to give timings.The museum is located a ten minute walk from City Hall MRT.<br/><br/>Next to the museum is a café to enjoy Peranakan cuisine and rest weary feet.<br/><br/>It would be good to combine this museum with a trip to Ba Ba House, which is a heritage home, which facilitates research and learning about the Peranakan community and its evolution. Be aware though that this museum is by appointment only.<br/><br/>So make sure you do spend an hour or two visiting this very visual and informative museum explaining about the Peranakan history and culture and how Singapore has become the diverse city it is today."
Lee San A,371,Sep 2013,August 2013,40,Understand Singapore Peranakan history and Have Fun,"Like this museum as you can understand the history. You can have a ""door Gift-Paper"". When you visit each station, you can use the mould and stamp on that ""paper"". Take you time in this museum and you may enjoy !"
Scot_On_Tour_10,48,Sep 2013,September 2013,40,Interesting insight,I arrived just in time for an informative guided tour of the museum - well worth it if you can manage it. The Peranakans are the descendants of mixed marriages between foreign traders and local Malay women. The museum concentrates on the Chinese Peranakans and gives you an insight into their culture and influence.
Tabby S,108,Sep 2013,August 2013,40,Throwing Clay Tablets from the Highest Floor!,"My friends and I decided to pop by the museum during the night festival. It was really crowded. The most interesting gimmick was being able to break things in the museum! Only the clay tablets, that is, at a mere SG$5 per pop. (Limited time only- not sure if it still runs) Totally unexpected crashes soon became the norm.  <br/><br/>Managed to see funeral- related things like tomb and mourning clothes.<br/><br/>Another strange thing was a black light room where lots of teens were scribbling on the walls with glow-in-the-dark markers.<br/><br/>Overall, an unexpected and fun museum trip! :)"
Ice-48,10,Sep 2013,September 2013,40,Great introduction to Peranakan history and culture,"I went to this museum on two occasions firstly during the night festival – it was packed and I didn’t really get a chance to look at things so thought I’d come back during the day. I’m glad I did, it is only a small museum and can be done in a relatively short period of time (there’s lots of places around it as well so you can spend a day in the area just exploring!).<br/><br/>I’d been told a fair bit about the Peranakan culture, but not so much about the history and although this museum only gives you a glance it’s a nice introduction to the culture. All the amazing beadwork items, clothes and pottery were beautiful to see! And for only S$6 who can say no! The first floor gives you an introduction to who Peranakan's are, the 2nd floor is all about the weddings (yes it needs a whole floor!), and finally the third floor has a little bit about other aspects, food, culture etc.<br/><br/>There are two tiny shops one has food and drink (best lemonade I’ve had in a long time in a jar). The second has general things you can buy, be warned when I say tiny I mean itty bitty!"
Mali_svetobeznici,60,Sep 2013,August 2013,50,Not to be missed!,"Should've visited this museum on our first day. However, even though we were extremely tired after several days of sightseeing I'm so glad we went. Very informative, learnt loads of the culture and history of Singapore and Malaysia. Some beautiful local embroidery that fascinated me as did the dining or wedding arrangements. <br/>If you are in a hurry, do make the mistake of running through it yourselves just reading the displays. BUT - if you have some time to spare - do get a guide. Our guide lady was excellent and she flooded us with first-hand knowledge about her people and customs.<br/>What is more, as we had our 2 kids with us (5&amp;7) I was surprised, the museum even had their own program for children. Kids got a a ""family treasures"" hunting wheel, on which they had several tasks to complete/find in the museum. Upon its completion they got a beautiful embossed stamp marking each step. Very well done. Kept them busy, they learnt a lot themselves from solving and reading the riddles and it kept us free to learn.<br/>Compared to the National Singapore Museum, if you have to choose just one museum to go to - this is the one.<br/>Highly recommend it."
Thung673,270,Sep 2013,October 2012,50,Little gem if you are interested in knowing more about the Peranakan,"the Peranakan museum is a beautiful museum for those interested in tracing back the origin of the Malay / indo/ chinese communities in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. Fascinating story telling in modern interactive displays in a historical building add to the charm of this museum. Easily spend up to 3-4 hours wandering its corridors and displays."
h2owitch,23,Sep 2013,August 2013,50,eye-opening,"Knowing about the Peranakan culture is essential to understanding Singapore and Malaysia. I learned a lot from it and if I were going back to Singapore, I'd visit the museum again.  The introductory exhibit which introduces the different branches of Peranakan peoples gives good preparation for the cultural exhibits to follow.  The explanations on earphones and screens were important to understanding what was displayed, although you could enjoy the displays on their own.  Sometimes there was a wait because another person was using the earphones.  <br/>An elevator is available for those who have difficulty with stairs.  The small attached gift shop has a variety of beautiful items, including several Peranakan cookbooks."
Bernee2013,136,Sep 2013,July 2013,40,An excellent Museum!,It was great to find out a bit more about the Peranakan culture. Loved the building and all the things on display in it. An easy walk from City Hall MRT and quite near to the Singapore Art Museum which could be visited at the same time.
Stefranconeri,10,Sep 2013,September 2013,50,Full immersion!,This should be your first stop in Singapore if you want to learn all about the local culture. The experience is like a travel in the past and it will make you look at Singapore with different eyes! The entrance is 6 Singapore $ and you will need at least a couple of hours to visit the museum. There are restaurants and coffee shops around to keep you going.

Heather B,159,Aug 2013,August 2013,50,Best Museum to visit in Singapore,The museum is small enough to visit in about an hour but gives you a real understanding of Peranakan history in Singapore.<br/>The guided tours are excellent and very interesting.  there are plenty of hands on activities to keep children occupied.
budgy26,233,Aug 2013,July 2013,50,Absolutely Wonderful,"Attractively designed, full of information without being boring ! History blends with mixed cultures and they came alive in this museum and even more vivid with our guide : Joan. It is interesting to witness the wedding ceremony of Peranakan Chinese mix, - don't miss to note the raw pig leg as the offering from the groom family to the bride's and what it symbolises; the progression of their traditional kebaya. For entrance fee of only $6; you will not regret visiting this museum."
Jan G,12,Aug 2013,March 2013,40,Step into a enchanting culture,"The peranakan museum is housed at the Old Tao Nan school( my beloved sch) and houses a collection of jewelry, costumes, household items and intricate embroidery. <br/>I love how each piece of history vividly recreates a time long past, of a lifestyle devoted to excellent cooking, hospitality and craftsmanship. <br/>Absolutely worth a visit though its a very tiny place."
SnowmanSnipe,147,Aug 2013,July 2013,50,Cultural and enlightening,"This is a beautiful museum - small in size but contains fascinating exhibits. My grandmother is Peranakan but so much of our roots and traditions are diluted. Visiting this museum struck a chord in my heart. The exhibits are well organized- from origins of peranakan people to the marriage rites, to clothes, items used, dining traditions, funeral rites etc. It's a great place to while away a hot Saturday afternoon. There is no Admission fee for locals but an admission fee of sgd6 is imposed on tourists. There is a quaint cafe outside and of course a gift shop for souvenirs!"
Don P,"14,531",Aug 2013,August 2013,40,Very nicely done focus on Peranakan culture and life,Small museum focused on Peranakan culture and lifestyle and it provides good information and insight.  Very enjoyable museum to learn about the Peranakan mixed culture that developed and evolved and what some of their every day life was like.
Kala R,342,Aug 2013,August 2013,50,entering the world of Peranankans,"today I visited the museum at Armenian street,close to the Canning rise and the singapore Philatelic Museum.<br/>Peranankan museum has three levels of exhibits.<br/>lets start at ground level.it says all about the definition of Who is a Peranankan.<br/>then it has beautiful depiction of how the names have come which people take on.<br/>then there is religion,food and feasting,the cultures.<br/>the wedding gallery was the best.It has huge exhibits of furniture ,jewellery and the clothes to be given away to a bride.<br/>It also showcases the origin of all these items.<br/>there are huge cabinets,red and gold,jewellery in gold and silver,unthinkable in modern days.<br/>the objects are well documented,well preserved.good lighting and music.clear guidance as to how the food is served in Noynaware.I took several pictures.I love to see museums,because tht is the only place where we can conenct with our past and also our heritage.must see.keep enough time to go around the place."
SihYing,58,Aug 2013,August 2013,40,a special taste of Singapore - the Peranakan style!,"This is a very unique presentation of a race in Singapore - the Straitsborn Chinese. <br/><br/>Come and experience this very special blend of Singapore and experience the tastes, cuisines, cultures and traditions of this very special group of people.<br/><br/>Come and watch the video presentation which clearly explains the meaning of the word Peranakan and it shows the origins of the ancestors of this community - some Peranakans have roots in Europe and Asia and some others are from Malaysia and Asia.<br/><br/>what I enjoy most is the section on Peranakan cuisine, embroidery, handiwork and their wedding practices.  <br/><br/>The Peranakan Museum is not a place to miss, if you like to find out more about Singapore's multicultural society, our culture and our traditions.<br/><br/>Also, there is a shop selling souvenirs and a little café selling only Perankan food, snacks and lovely meals served in Peranakan style!<br/><br/>Come and see and experience this special part of Singapore!"
Phillyjanie,221,Aug 2013,July 2013,50,So interesting,This museum really explains local society. I found it fascinating and it's literally around the corner from the National Museum.
antHongKong,25,Aug 2013,July 2013,40,Well worth a visit,The museum provides a great insight into the culture of the Peranakans but is not overwhelming. The display is very colourful and interesting.
Leny Y,76,Aug 2013,June 2013,40,Not much as I expected...,"Quite okay... it's a building with ""stack of floors"", pretty much you can see, but there's no lift... Stairs are everywhere, quite tiring. Not recommended if you bring young children.<br/>Else, you can see the culture of Peranakan 3 nations: Malay, Chinese, and Singapore.. and about how they grow... all the habits when Peranakan society got married, birth, dead.. etc.<br/>They put it visually, so overall for me, this place is okay :)"
Sidmar H,29,Aug 2013,July 2013,50,Peranakan is small but good!,"This museum has everything I like:  lots of jewelry, wedding clothes, wedding traditions, and textiles, especially beadworking with super tiny beads.  The Peranakan peoples are the early settlers of Singapore and this museum displays their ways of life from food, wedding customs, babies, furniture, and ceramics.  Really nice place."
David S,40,Jul 2013,November 2012,30,Expected more,Seems like just bits and pieces are displayed. The exhibits seemed oddly coordinated centering on a few daily activities.
Tolis P,8,Jul 2013,March 2013,50,Every time I want to know more about Singapore...,"... I go to the Peranakan Museum. Every time a friend is passing through or visits, I either send them or go with them. It is a small but nicely laid out Museum with lots of detailed information of Singapore's mixed cultural and ethnic background. Easy to take in the information laid out and all the personnel I friendly and accommodating."
Simon E,48,Jul 2013,May 2013,50,Fantastic insight,"Not usually high on most tourists 'must see' list but take time out to visit. If you don't know who the Peranakan's are/were and how they influence Singapore life, you really really have to visit the museum. Not a bad Peranakan restaurant next door...if a little grumpy staff. This won't be boring for the kids either. It shows, history, customs, dress, food exceptionally well done. Get a guide - cheap and worth it."
iTravel_Dave,48,Jul 2013,May 2013,20,Just another Museum,"This Museum is too small. you can finish it in one hour time. Unless you are very keen in history between malay &amp; chinese marriage. If not, you will find it boring."
Uta L,40,Jul 2013,February 2013,40,Interesting,Went with my daughter's class and really enjoyed the visit. Manages to stay behind when they went back to school to get a quiet look at the exhibition. Gives a good insight into one part of Singaporean society. Done very well for kids and adults alike.
bene66,13,Jul 2013,August 2012,50,beautiful little museum,"We have been at least 5 time there with the kids. Not too big, very colourful. Various rooms to enjoy. For everyone."

Julie S,59,Jul 2013,July 2013,40,pleasant visit,A small museum but a very pleasant visit and my kids got to understand a bit of the Peranakan culture!<br/>Free admission for Singaporeans and Singapore PR holders.<br/>All other visitors have to pay.<br/>Adult: $6<br/>Child:  $3
duntiblaesnob,210,Jul 2013,July 2013,40,A lovely museum with excellent displays,This is the place to visit if you are interested in learning about the story behind the mix of races in singapore.

Baarie,9,Jul 2013,June 2013,30,ok-ish,I did not see exabitons that you had to pay for. This is free if you are a Singapore resident otherwise its $15 But dose give you some information on Singapore people who have exturanry lives
olderfolks,138,Jul 2013,July 2013,30,Average,This is a smallish museum which traces the history and culture of the Peranakan peoples of south-east Asia.<br/>What there is of it is quite well done and those with an interest in textiles and furniture will find it repays a visit.
David H,89,Jul 2013,June 2013,40,Lots of exhibits of wedding traditions,"This museum is housed in a very attractive historic building. Its exhibits cover the people who came from other parts of Asia and married and settled in Singapore – Peranakans. It gives interesting insights into how they came to Singapore and how they lived. There are free guided tours.<br/><br/>The exhibit is especially strong in the area of Peranakan wedding traditions. If you aren't very interested in weddings, your visit will not be as long."
age_m82,27,Jun 2013,April 2013,30,Learn about the Peranakan history,"Like: the lovely building architecture!! all the intricate design of Peranakan wedding tradition, interesting 'telephone' conversation, bring blank color paper/white paper to stamp for free. <br/><br/>Dislike: Tourists will be charged $6, but locals can go for free. However, museum securities/front desk people not as friendly with tourists. Ask one of them to take picture for all of us and they refused. We were a bit dumbfounded by their unfriendliness"
wea74,19,Jun 2013,June 2013,40,interesting,I found it hard to get a handle on this culture and the signage didn't help that much.  I found it more a curiosity than anything else.  I wouldn't bother if I had limited time.
sand2skis,331,Jun 2013,July 2012,50,"A ""Must Do"" for tourists &amp; locals alike","I have been visiting Singapore regularly over the last 30+ years, and with every visit, I find the Singapore of Old further eroded by more development and modernisation. Singapore has lost much (some would argue, almost all) of its original character and charm. <br/><br/>Much of it is visually obvious in the absence of old Colonial and Peranakan buildings, having been demolished to make way for new commercial buildings. What is not so apparent is the erosion of one of the region's significant people and distinctive cultures - the Peranakans (or Nyonya-Baba). A people who were historically integral to the fabric of Singapore and Malaya.  <br/><br/>I could expand on the Peranakans but I will refrain from doing so as it will take much too long. However suffice to say that Singapore and Malaysia's rich history and development over centuries would indubitably be vastly different and lesser (in my humble opinion), if not for the Peranakans. For those interested, all you need do is Google the term 'Peranakan' on the internet. <br/><br/>Given that Peranakan culture and its tangible being (in the form of eg buildings, dress, furniture, artwork and so on) are fast disappearing through modernisation and influx of literally thousands of expats and foreign-born people, the Peranakan Museum is an indispensable heritage institution.<br/><br/>My visit to the museum was in 2010 and was the highlight of my vacation. For me personally, it brought back many wonderful memories of growing up in Singapore and Malaysia. <br/><br/>I have no doubt that the Peranakan Museum will be a wonderful experience for all visitors - whether a local, an expat who has spent years working in Singapore or the casual tourist to the country.<br/><br/>The museum is well organised and presented, with a comprehensive collection of displays. Descriptions of exhibits were concise, yet adequately comprehensive, to provide the reader with a good level of information without being boring or tedious. The museum is on my list of 'things to do' on my next visit to Singapore.    <br/><br/>Entry cost is reasonable and I would recommend allocating between 3 to 4 hours to do justice to the museum and its exhibits. If pushed for time, allow 1.5 to 2 hours for a quick overview. A guided tour is highly recommended.<br/><br/>The museum is located in town, adjacent to the historical Fort Canning and a short walk from famous Orchard Road. <br/><br/>Lastly, for those visiting Malaysia, there is also a Peranakan Museum in Penang. I have not been there before but it is definitely on my list."
CowSense,979,Jun 2013,June 2013,50,"The Peranakan Museum at 39 Armenian Street, Singapore","The Peranakan Museum is a collection of Nonya history and artifacts in the old Tao Nan School. You can see  Nonya costumes and dress, wedding jewelry and  gift from  groom to the bride. The Paranakan profess Buddhist, Toaist and  Christianity.  They eat pork  though they dress like the Malays. There are lifts for the elderly who cannot climb the steps on the staircase."

TripTalkHawaii,567,Jun 2013,May 2013,50,Rich heritage of multi-culturalism,"This lovely museum housed in colonial period architecture has very small gift shop and coffee shop, too. Collection explores the multi-cultural background and traditions of the Peranakans. We took about 2 hours to visit each floor. Ask for the scavenger hunt sheet and be sure to make your impressions as you go along. Nicely done. Quality museum experience."
Sally P,66,May 2013,May 2013,50,An insight into a fascinating culture,"I really enjoyed this museum - and I'm a fairly keen museum visitor. It's in a beautiful building which includes a small, but interesting, shop of all things Paranakan to the left of the entrance where I bought several Nonya cookbooks. The exhibits are organised by theme - weddings, birth, religion, death, food, kitchens and dining, pottery, pastimes (eg beadwork), jewellery, a display of beautiful kebayas, information about the lives of significant Peranankn people etc. As you go through the museum,  there are many short films about different aspects of Perankan culture which you can watch with earphones while sitting on a small stool - much appreciated as I had already done so much walking in Singapore my legs were starting to give out. And, of course, the films  really bring the culture to life if, like me, you knew very little about it except for its delicious food! Don't miss the small sculpture of a cat on the front steps of the museum!"
SKBrizzles,77,May 2013,May 2013,50,Very interesting and enjoyabke,A very interesting place. I would recommend asking for a guide when you get there because they bring the house alive and explain the history of the house and previous owners which you would not get if you just walked around on your own.

Housed in a former school building, the museum contains beautifully restored artifacts from the Peranakan, ie, Straits-born Chinese, community, who are unique to Southeast Asia.  The museum is tightly compacted to allow visitors to explore every facet of Peranakan life and culture without breaking a sweat.  If your timing is right, you just might be able to join one of the museum's very informative guided tours.

The displays are gorgeous - the hand beaded embroidery, the clothes, the dishes.  Well worth a visit"
thumbelina,25,May 2013,May 2013,50,Perfectly formed and perfectly charming,"I visited the museum with my in-laws and my four year old son, and we all thoroughly enjoyed the experience.<br/>We spent a couple of hours exploring the beautiful exhibits, which were set out using a variety of display techniques and interactive channels so that we all gained something from it.<br/>Having moved to Singapore within the past year I found it a fascinating introduction to the Peranakan culture, which improved my understanding of Singapore's cultural history and threw up some interesting stories that left me keen to uncover more. <br/>The artwork, from textiles to porcelain, is stunning and the interactive displays helped my young son to maintain interest in the numerous displays.<br/>I often become overwhelmed with museums, feeling compelled to read every word and scrutinise every object. This museum was perfectly sized as far as I was concerned, providing just the right amount of information and exhibited material to introduce the subject matter without swamping the audience. It is not an exhaustive source of information, but a wonderful and charming way to spend an afternoon, which I would definitely recommend."

The museum examines the Peranakan culture through various rites of passage like weddings and funerals, as well as through food, religion, public service and so on.

There's nothing flashy about it but it does a very good job helping one understand how Singapore evolved and its rich cultural roots. It's a fine example of a multicultural community that works."

bella_sigar,151,Apr 2013,March 2013,40,In depth museum of Peranakan in Singapore,"I specially put museums in my itinerary while in Singapore, along with my daughter who love museums. We arrived late, and only spend around 1hour, not enough to read all the captions of all the displays  :(. <br/>They give discount for foreign student too<br/>While we we were here, they display about Emily of Emerald Hill, made us know more about the famous play. <br/>Security officers were tight, once we wanted to put our eyes closer to one display about kitchen's utilities, one of the security officer said not to touch the display otherwise alarm will be activated automatically.<br/>I love Museum's collection of peranakan's dress.. <br/>Would like to come back and explore more .."
Hans B,8,Apr 2013,February 2013,50,A museum well worth visiting,"Most interesting ! The exhibitions were giving a view into the peranakan way of  living in earlier days , displaying many beautiful items ."
Draxir,38,Apr 2013,March 2013,40,Walk into the history briefly,A great display to show to culture of Paranakan. Interesting mix of cultures through trades in the 1800's~1900's. Some traditional Chinese traditions are better preserved here than in China.  <br/><br/>Very fantastic to have a peranakan guide to share with us the stories of herself and her grandma.  She's funny and knowledgeable.  Made a huge difference to the experience!
ScooterOz,161,Apr 2013,March 2013,40,Very interesting shot of Peranakan culture,I always go here when in Singapore as I love the displays of Peranakan culture. Well worth a visit and provides an insight into modern Singapore culture.
Angelbaby_Ong,53,Apr 2013,January 2013,50,The Transform Culture between Chinese and Malay,"For oversea tourist, you may understand how the culture change while the chinese Travel from China and Married to a local Malay Lady.

wwtravelerRochester,171,Mar 2013,March 2013,40,Very good but not great,"I had been threatening to go for 5 years and I finally went. The museum in an old house. It is quite interesting but somehow seemed to be missing something that would make the story/history of the Peranakans more cohesive/interesting/exciting. There is a lot of artifacts, labels, furniture and exhibits that will take over an hour to cover. It is definitely worth a trip once but once is enough"
Lokman26,4,Mar 2013,March 2013,50,Learned a lot of the pernakan heritage and customs,It was my first museum in Singapore for me so I did not have any expectations. I went into the museum just to be entertained and learn some knew Asian culture. I was in awe when I first walked in. The staircases in the lobby were maginifcent and the whole building was set up so that you would be entertained the whole time you've been there. I knew some of the pernakan people but after this visit I have learned so much more about their heritage and customs.
chique,22,Mar 2013,January 2013,50,A must visit,"If there is  time for only one attraction, you should visit the peranakan museum. The peranakans have such a rich and interesting culture. The food, the clothes and the people. . . There is something about the peranakans that sets them apart and makes them unique. The museum is cosy and not overwhelming. At times, the Peranakan museum may have activities and plays, organized informative tours within the museum. You never know what to expect and each visit can bring about a totally new experience even if you have been there before. The kebaya outfits worn by the Peranakans have such lovely and intricate designs that the traditional Nonyas still wear them up till today for weddings, Chinese new year and special events. After visiting the museum, you can visit the shop to get some nice souvenirs and fill your stomachs with authentic peranakan food at the restaurant nearby. You may not find this museum anywhere else in the world. If you happen to be there at the right time , you may even be able to catch a live jazz performance :)"
bristol411,178,Mar 2013,March 2013,50,A culture which summarises Singapore,A great little museum which gives an insight into the racial and cultural mix that makes Singapore such a wonderful place to spend time when you hate shopping!
Borisbear,63,Mar 2013,June 2012,50,Enter a colourful world,"When I heard that the Peranakan Museum is an arm of the Asian Civilization Museum I was keen to go. In my book, the Asian Civilization Museum is a marvel. The Peranakan Museum does not disappoint.<br/>With friendly and helpful guides to take you through the old school that now houses the displayit has on display one of a marvelous collection of Peranakan objects. The galleries are all fascinating. The distinctive and colourful displays of the visual arts of the Peranakan traditions are a delight. <br/>Well worth a visit if you are keen to understand a little more about Southeast Asian Culture and the inter mixing of traders from all over the world with local people who became the ancestors of the Peranakans."
Bob K,271,Mar 2013,March 2013,50,Very interesting and informative,Before our visit I knew nothing of the lives and contributions made by people of mixed race to the development of Singapore.  The museum is simple but well-presented and it gave us a real insight to the past and present experiences of the Peranakan people
Anna Lissa M,71,Mar 2013,April 2012,50,Traditions,This is a must go place to learn about the history of Peranakans here in SG. It is well done and nicely designed.
respect_uluru,9,Mar 2013,March 2013,30,It should've been free...,"...seeing it depicts the history of the nation's majority residents. I had a great time but there was a whole floor dedicated to a famous play which I thought it was over the top and it lacked info on food!!!! And you'd think it should've been shown first up!!! Overall, I liked it but should've been free to attract more people and to promote the perankan culture...PS: I'm not a peranakan by any means..."
tanagogo1,998,Mar 2013,NA,50,Engaging museum,"I am not typically a museum lover to be honest, but this was a wonderful experience. The museum is set in an old school and you can almost feel the presence of hundreds of noisy children running up and down the stairs at break time. It's not one of the mainstream museums in Singapore, but perhaps that was part of the charm. I was lucky enough to be able to join one of the guided tours. This gave me a great insight into the wonderful culture that is Peranakan. The docent was very knowledgable on all things Peranakan and was an enthusiastic and engaging guide. The cost of the tour was only $5 per head and well worth the money. Some wonderful artefacts although unfortunately quite a few key pieces were on show at other museums. This place has a nice feel to it. Not stuffy and stifled like many museums but open friendly and personal. A nice touch. Go!"
PEISpud1938,14,Mar 2013,February 2013,50,A Great Taste of Local Culture,"A wonderful place to learn about the Peranakan culture. Although housed in a small place, its exhibits are well displayed, documented and definitely worth examining. There are interactive booths and little nooks to explore. We enjoyed the guided tour conducted by local volunteers dressed in Peranakan costume. The souvenir shop is also interesting and stocks lots of neat gifts to bring home with you. Well worth the walk off the beaten track and definitely a must-visit to get to know local culture. Wish there were other museums showcasing other cultures as well."
Wilson L,3,Mar 2013,December 2012,50,Unique,Wow. The lifestyle and culture. <br/><br/>Very unique and its history. <br/><br/>The art and craft used daily are wonderfully displayed
PUFUS,57,Mar 2013,February 2013,50,Nice surprise,"This is a small, but lovely museum. I didn't know who ""peranakans"" are; now I do :). The staff is also very kind. Nice experience!"
Scool_sgm,114,Mar 2013,March 2013,50,Interesting,"The museum is easy to find, friendly staffs and enjoyed Emily of Emerald Hill, especially the video presentation. Thank you."
Andry M,267,Mar 2013,NA,30,Far frok expectation,"The museum was nice. But the info given was so plain, i cant feel like im in the middle of the peranakan. For me still lack information. And they dont create their house turn into a real peranakan architectural.<br/><br/>Actually im expecting being on a peranakan home with their awesome meubel, but it is only by movie."
carlos f,113,Mar 2013,December 2012,50,To learn(briefly) in 90 minutes the history of Singapore,It is a very well design and didactic interactive museum. Without even a tour guide you can learn how the past and actual Singaporean(peranakan) culture was developed. Very interesting.
Beverly B,16,Mar 2013,March 2013,50,Fascinating Ethnic Museum,"Tiny Singapore's history is fascinating, heartbreaking, complicated and ultimately triumphant. From the Chinese travelers on the monsoon winds and their relationship with the native peoples, to one of the most modern and successful cities in the world, the museum puts it all in perspective and tells the story in a most interesting way. I've been there twice and will go again if my travels bring me back this way."
SharonCapeCod,75,Mar 2013,February 2013,40,Great museum to explore your Chinese roots,"Peranakans are mixed-race Sinaporeans, but the museum seemed to be mostly themed around Chinese heritage.  Lovely old building, and displays were very educational."
DominiqueUltee,"1,090",Feb 2013,February 2013,40,'Emily of Emerald Hill - Singaporean Identity on Stage' Exhibition,"Okay, finally I made it here to visit the gorgeous Peranakan Museum<br/><br/>I took bus No. 36 (stopped at SMU, then took around 5 mins walk) to the Peranakan Museum. It looks absolutely stunning of its Peranakan architecture, which is very fond of pastel colors and intricate designs. <br/><br/>Get to know more about the Peranakan history and its stories, here is the place. Under the great influence from China, India and western style, the style of Peranakan is unique. I enjoyed seeing the most was the beautiful china in the house. Renowned for the colourful and decorative pattern. <br/><br/>The True Blue Cafe in the house is very stylish too, I was impressed. However, taste of food was.... so-so, but quite costly. For example, I ordered one 'tofu salad', it came up with a tofu  unpacked from container without any treatment. It served with some beans and then it costs SGD 7+ ? Seriously... very simple dish which I can make better... anyhow, I think it absolutely goes for its location and environment.."
omahdarwin,24,Feb 2013,February 2013,50,stimulating and interesting,We were privelaged to be taken by our friend Penny who does  tours at the Museum.  Although we have been and have some knowledge of Singpore history it was stimulating and interesting to go through the history of the mixed cultural origins of the inhabitants of the modern Singapore of today.  For the small fee and location we would recommend it to everyone.
NomadicmanTA,75,Feb 2013,February 2013,40,Well worth a visit,"The Peranakans evolved as a distinct minority social group from the marriage of rich foreign traders and local Malay women. The museum has a superb collection of amazing artifacts: incredible furniture and tableware, and many items relating to wedding ceremonies. The tour we took was excellent and well worth the small fee."
tiberica,84,Feb 2013,February 2013,40,Interesting informations bout Singapore,"I recommend to visit the Museum when the volunteer guide is available to guide you as there are many infomations and fact to hear from them.<br/>If you are a Museum person, I definitly recommend this one."
chrichen,277,Feb 2013,January 2013,40,Very interesting introduction to Southeast Asia culture,"Visiting and staying once a year in Singapore I decided to discover this museum as a flight attendant from Singapore Airlines recommended it warmly to me on my flight to Frankfurt to Changi airport, the stewardesses wearing a lovely  Peranakan traditional costume. I visited most of the most famous museums in the world and was wondering about this one. I was not disappointed and I recommend it for  curious visitors waning t to immerse in the Southeast Asian culture during their stay in Singapore.  You will understand the mixed cultural origins of the inhabitants of the modern Singapore."
Sipke B,14,Feb 2013,February 2013,50,Great for short time,Afterwards go eating at he blue pantry when you enter the building on your right hand. Great traditional food. Good service as well.
HansvandeBunte,106,Feb 2013,November 2012,40,very special storyline on Singapore's inhabitants,"In an old historic building the storyline is being told about the inhabitants of Singapore. The mixed families of Chinees, indian and Malay people shared their cultures and mingled into new cultural entities. A lovely museum to understand Singapores diverse cultures."
C0rnMuffin,163,Feb 2013,January 2013,50,Interesting museum for the culturally curious,"I really liked this Museum.  It's only about 2.5 stories, and took me ~2 hours to go through the whole thing (I read almost everything).  It's interesting to learn about the culture and history of the Peranakans, which is shared by many Singaporeans.  In a city that's so global and modern, it's fun to learn about the history behind it.  I didn't go to any other museums in Singapore (besides art museums), due to time constraints, so I don't have any comparisons.  I came here because it was raining, so I had to cancel my other outdoor plans, but I'm glad I did.  They have a student discount."
BauerDeutsch,10,Feb 2013,March 2012,50,"Quaint, endearing","Well I like funky local museums, too, and this one qualifies.  Gives you a great look at the rich past of your Paranakan (Chinese Malaysian) friends.  Loved the kitchen display the best."
Yofi_L,120,Feb 2013,April 2012,40,Well kept and presented,"The existence of Peranakan Museum seems very understated, compared to Art Science Museum in Marina Bay Sands for example. It's really interesting to learn that most people in Southeast Asia is 'peranakan' or interracial between different ethnicity, and the resulting culture of the assimilation is well presented in this museum. I think the trip was worth taking for us to understand our roots better. We took the guided tour (the guide is very informative). The most memorable part is about the wedding. Overall this museum has a good job in exhibiting the collection in a way that it tells you a story and bring you back to the older era."
KeenTraveller117,104,Jan 2013,February 2012,50,Amazing museum!,"Housed in a large Peranakan house on Armenian Street, this beautifully restored museum tells the tale of the Peranakan people's of the Malay Straits, with a great collection of photos, costumes and furniture. Very interesting little museum."
Gill823,4,Jan 2013,December 2012,40,Little window into a poorly known topic,Like - information especially from 'long ago'; lockers; airconditioning...<br/>Dislike - no informal restaurant nearby that served that cuisine
Mackas12,71,Jan 2013,February 2012,50,A beautiful way to spend some time,We loved our visit to this museum . The quality of their exhibits is fantastic.Although i dont think the children would find it as interesting.
Tracey H,26,Jan 2013,January 2013,50,History,"This is a great place to see some of Singapores history. The beading, embroidery and furniture are exquisite as well as the historical stories."
maxw0206,23,Jan 2013,January 2013,50,Informative and well presented,"We wanted to learn more about some of the people of Singapore, and this was an excellent place to do so. Good exhibits, well planned text (enough but not too much), beautifully laid out. And not expensive."
Uli62166,34,Jan 2013,July 2012,50,Do not miss,Found it more or less by accident and was very happy that I took the time for a tour. Very nice guided tour by a passionate volountier
Jeffuk4,"1,051",Jan 2013,January 2013,50,Great,We visit this every time we visit Singapore and this provides great background to the Peranakans.  If you can also arrange to see Baba House.  If you are over 60 remember to take your passport for reduced admisiion.
sodiumion,51,Jan 2013,January 2013,40,Interactive musuem,"I liked that the museum was very informative. Some parts of it, like the Emily of Emerald Hill exhibit was very interactive - it even had an area where you could make a video recording of yourself reading lines from the actual play.<br/><br/>The museum is very well-planned out in terms of areas of display and gives a lot of information on the Peranakans' way of life, language and origins. You could also collect stamps from various stations around the museum. But you'd have to bring your own paper to collect them, though. <br/><br/>What was a pity was that there was no real section that displayed the food heritage that was traditionally Peranakan. There was a tok panjang, but no food could be found around the museum. If there was, it would have been fantastic, and definitely worth a visit for tourists to the Peranakan Museum, and then to a Peranakan restaurant for some real action."
Bibsterina,"1,201",Jan 2013,December 2012,40,Nice Way to discover the Peranakan Culture,"Being a Peranakan from Penang, I have been to lots of Peranakan Museums and this one is the best! If you are new to this culture, a guide would be a good start and then browse around on your own later for photos.  The building is beautiful over 3 storeys and covers all that i want to know about the Peranakan Culture.  It's a good day out for all of us!"
linshimm,79,Jan 2013,October 2012,40,Interesting and Colourful,I didn't know anything about Peranakan culture before I went to the Peranakan Museum.  The colourful displays are a window into the lives of a people who evolved in Singapore.  Very interesting and informative with imaginative displays.
LarRanTravels,635,Jan 2013,February 2012,50,Loved it...,I learned so much about the Peranakan culture and Singapore.  It was very interesting and I would highly recommend it.  Allow at least 2 hours.
CowTails,82,Jan 2013,December 2012,40,Needs time to absorb everything,You get headsets to walk around with and you click on the number at each exhibit and it tells you more. Actually you need to use the headset because there is no written info at each exhibit. Takes a while to figure out how to get to some of the info but its a good 2 hours or so absorbing most of the main display on the history of Singapore.
dhar81,18,Jan 2013,November 2012,40,Fun and Enlightening!,"Quaint and colonial! This museum consists of floor levels of all things Peranakan. Excellent place for tourists wanting to gain an cutural understanding of Singaporeans. Also, a good family day activity wanting to understand our heritage."
ialmostforgot,259,Dec 2012,July 2012,50,Very unique museum!,They have artifacts and informations to introduce you about peranakan's history and life in Singapore. It's fascinating!
Gunner do,523,Dec 2012,June 2012,50,Soak up Singapore history.,A good place to acquaint yourself with the history of Singapore and the people who made it so.History buffs will love it.
DrJimT,59,Dec 2012,May 2012,50,An historic gem,"Close to the National Museum and others, the Peranakan Museum celebrates the peak of Peranakan culture in Singapore. Walk through a wedding procession, pass through the kitchen and dining rooms, carefully reconstructed, and marvel at the lives of the women who made beautiful beaded slippers in cloistered isolation, waiting to be matched with husbands. The one-hour guided tour is the best way to see the museum, and you can stay much longer to learn in more depth or just enjoy the elegance of a time past."
ChristopherDillon,48,Dec 2012,December 2012,40,Intriquing insights,"A little gem of a museum highlighting the Peranakan culture that is a such an important part of Singapore. The museum covers everything from Peranakan history to birth, death and marriage rituals. Excerpts from the one-woman show ""Emily of Emerald Hill; were particularly interesting."
singlish_sg,442,Dec 2012,January 2012,50,"""This museum is one of a kind in Asia"".","PRO:<br/>~Housed in a beautiful historical building, good to take photos with the facade outside.<br/>~Though small in size, the exhibits are elaborate and very historical based. Would be good to attend a guided tour for explanation.<br/>~Ample parking.<br/><br/>CON:<br/>~The nearest bus stop is quite a walk away."
Klwl,21,Dec 2012,February 2012,50,A Unique Cultural Experience,"The Peranakans, otherwise known as the Straits Chinese, is a race and culture unique to Singapore and Malaysia, arising from the inter-marriages between the Malays and Chinese. There are elements of both Chinese and Malay cultures, and yet the Peranakans have their own distinct way of life, dressing, jewelry, ceremonies, customs, cuisines and even language.<br/><br/>The Peranakan Museum (or TPM in short) showcases the various aspects of Peranakans and their way of life under different galleries. Housed in a 4-storey conserved building that used to be a school, TPM is located in the city center, within walking distance from the City Hall MRT Station.<br/><br/>Stepping into TPM, one can already feel a different ambience of the past, with wooden staircases winding up four sides of an open and spacious central foyer. One of the most fascinating gallery documents the Peranakan wedding ceremony, which is full of resplendence, richness and majesty.<br/><br/>Another must-see gallery is the beading embroidery. Peranakan girls were trained from young by their mothers to create colourful and beautiful patterns using tiny a needle, thread and thousands of tiny beads. These were used as covers of sandals and other decorative items. The girls were also trained to cook Peranakan cuisines. Potential mother-in-laws would judge the suitability of a girl as a future daughter-in-law based on how good her cooking and embroidery skills were.<br/><br/>The sarong kebaya, which is unique to the culture, is also showcased in TPM. The top/blouse has no buttons and is held together with special and ornate pins made of gold or silver. Different styles and designs are exhibited.<br/><br/>Be prepared to spend at least half a day there. If you want to savour authentic Peranakan cuisine after the visit, there is a Peranakan restaurant nearby."
daisymereles,12,Dec 2012,December 2012,50,Very well organised Museum,"Hope they had such Museum back home, had a very good appreciation of Singapore's Peranakan origin, culture, festival. This is highly recommended. You will need at least two hours to walk the place.... I hear that Singapore Museums are all very well maintained. I hope to visit the Art Museum and National Museum during the Christmas Holidays. This visit is helpful especially if you work in Singapore as a expat."
bellybearybell,161,Dec 2012,November 2012,40,Now I know what is Peranakan,"Be a Malaysian doesn't guaranteed that I know exactly what is peranakan as we don't normally use this word to describe our culture, but this museum open a wide unknown world to me which I appreciated so much for letting me understanding what is our country and culture all about. Unique and interesting but is there a section showing the current life of peranakan? Cz most of them are the traditional display and I'm pretty sure most of the travelers would know how do they lived like in nowadays."
Jana C,"3,637",Dec 2012,January 2012,50,Excellent Peranakan Museum,This is a lovely museum and if you are spending a longer time in Singapore or coming back you can spend few hours here out of the heat and enjoy some excellent exhibitions. You will also learn about the life of Peranakan people which is very interesting.
halilley,463,Dec 2012,November 2012,40,A New Side to Singapore,A new museum for us although very close to the hotel we always use.  It brought out in a very thorough way the history and current story of the people who are the Singaporeans.<br/><br/>This is a museum for adults although they try to cater for children.
GPenaflorida,"1,105",Dec 2012,NA,40,Worth a visit.,"Having already visited the Peranakan museums in Melaka &amp; Penang (Malaysia), I was quite excited to visit this museum. Traveling by MRT to Bras Basah station &amp; then continuing on foot, I didn't have any problem finding the place.<br/><br/>The building, which was once a school, had had a good make over &amp; looked lovely with its details in plaster &amp; iron works. The reception/ticket counter was bright &amp; cheery from the natural sunlight &amp; the vibrant colours of the back wall behind the reception. Admission fee is S$6 &amp; I was quite fortunate to have arrived just in time for the guided tour. You are allowed to take photos, just no flash.<br/><br/>I was especially pleased that the Emily of Emerald Hill exhibition was on during my visit &amp; enjoyed the video presentation, a collection of video snippets featuring performances by various actors who played Emily. Also, the various artifacts &amp; props on display, as well as little activity area.<br/><br/>There is a decent collection of Peranakan artifacts here &amp; even if you have been to other such museums, the Peranakan heritage is so rich, diverse &amp; colourful that there will be facts you may not have known, things that you may not have seen or variations of things to discover."
Relie,33,Nov 2012,June 2012,40,Good place to learn about Peranakan culture,"This museum showcase the Peranakan culture, dresses, housewares...etc. Free guided tours are available in English, Mandarin and Japanese at selected timings."

GannieMo,38,Nov 2012,October 2012,50,Lovely little museum,"This is a relatively small museum but it is full of fascinating information, clothes and customs of the Peranakan People"
Jan E,695,Nov 2012,September 2012,50,Charming little museum....,"Singapore is good with museums - straightforward, nothing too flashy.  Just well presented and interesting. This museum is no exception.  Foreign tourists may not find the ""Emily of Emerald Hill"" exhibit as fascinating as residents of Emerald Hill or SG residents with a lifelong understanding of  SG family/social life.  I am guessing that if you have grown up in this culture, the characters depicted in this play - and their quirky characteristics - would resonate. The tea shop next door is tiny and quaint - sweet staff. A little pricey. Not the place for a hoarde of ravenous teenage boys....."
LaniSingapore,133,Nov 2012,September 2012,40,A quiet corner of our history,"This little museum is cozy and neat. It has interesting exhibits of our Peranakan culture. When I visit, I feel like I'm going back in time to somewhere in my childhood. I always enjoy a visit there."
ChloeBo,9,Nov 2012,September 2012,50,Thoroughly interesting,The tour guide was great and clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about the Peranakan history and culture which made the tour even more enjoyable.
edkemp2002,297,Oct 2012,October 2012,30,Prior knowledge helps,This museum has a great collection both in quality and variety of Peranakan artifacts but unless you know a little about the Peranakan culture it may well be lost on you as a culture struggling to survive in modern Singapore.
123163,28,Oct 2012,October 2012,50,Very interesting,"Great museum to visit even if you know a lot about the subject. So many photographs and artifacts, we also enjoyed watching the video presentation of Emily... The staff at the front desk even helped us when we said we wanted to go to JooChiat, and directed us to Bus # 12, which stops right in front of the museum. We had a delicious laksa at East Coast Rd there and took many pics of beautifully restored houses in the area."
Bill N,192,Oct 2012,September 2012,40,Discovering culture,"It was time for me to sit while the wife had a look around; she was impressed with the layout of each area that show cased different types culture, silk and pottery. Not for the kids if I had kids with me it would have been the ice cream shop while she looked around. You need to asked when it is open the day we went it didn’t open until after lunch. Yes to stairs about 4 flights no lift"
Lynn T,108,Oct 2012,October 2012,40,Interesting museum,"Explains very well the initial Chinese immigrants and they integration into the society and after.  Very rich in heritage.  Maybe the museum should have a good peranankan restaurant run a small eatery so visitors understand with their taste buds the richness in heritage for the cross between Chinese, Eurasian and Malay cooking"
maliwoo,555,Oct 2012,September 2012,40,A great museum experience,"What an interesting museum, and so well set up for kids. Especially school age kids, there are a lot of interesting hands-on activities. It is all in a wonderful old historic house, just beautuful, with wonderfully interesting exhibits on every floor. Very glad I went."
RubyAustralia,666,Oct 2012,October 2012,30,Not a huge lot to see,It was an okay exhibition but we felt they could have done more with so much history. The rooms were full of glass cabinets with old coolie clothese  and weapons and the way they used to live and an Aga Khan exhibition but there wasn't a lot to see in the way of exhibits we felt
Maria M,117,Oct 2012,February 2012,40,An Unfamiliar History Page,"In the West, I mean. I didn't know much about the history of Singapore and its people before coming to the Peranakan Museum, so I learnt a lot there. The museum is not too big, but very interesting and well worth the money. The exhibition covers various aspects of life of Peranakans in Singapore, from birth to death. There are clothes, furniture, religious objects and antique home appliences, e.g., century-old telephones on display.<br/>Highly recommendable."
Harisap,142,Oct 2012,NA,30,Small museum in a fantastic building,The content of the museum is interesting and informative but for me I found much of the exhibits a little too recent for my liking. There was not enough emphasis on the past history and more weighted to the recent history. <br/><br/>However the displays were well laid out and presented and informative in the labels provided. <br/><br/>I did enjoy the building and found the architecture and quality of this museum really stealing the show. <br/><br/>Cheap entrance fee is also a plus.
bluey_way,447,Oct 2012,August 2012,30,A very good short journey on Peranakan.,"Do you know Peranakan?<br/>It's worth a visit to Peranakan Museum Singapore in order to understand more on culture of Peranakan group and also of Singapore. <br/>Young people, museum is not only meant for primary school students. It can be an eye-opening outing with friends as well.<br/><br/>For foreigner, the entrance fee is SD6.  <br/>It can be reached from City Hall Mrt plus some walking."
LesleyHall,18,Oct 2012,September 2012,50,Very interesting trip,This was very educational as even though I had visited Singapore many times I had nevery known about this museum or the Pernakan people.
Dekakuri,41,Oct 2012,December 2011,40,Nice,"Small but well-organised museum depicting the history of the first 'true' Singaporeans. A lovely mix of Chinese and Malay cultures, the Peranakans were the rich, founders of modern Singapore. They ornate houses and flamboyant culture is still apparent in modern Singapore. Not the best museum in Singapore but worth a peak if you have time."
AmethystAme,891,Sep 2012,August 2012,40,Good one,"I had been to this museum many year ago and recently due to the free entry offered to Local. I went there again. I cannot remember my last visit but the recent one was great. I got to know the history of Baba and Nyonya more and it mentioned peranakan history from Malaysia and Singapore.<br/><br/>You can view the clothes, the utensil, the house, the setting..their culture and arts. This is worth visiting and really interesting."
pink63,23,Sep 2012,September 2012,50,Loved this museum,"This museum is near Clark Quay and it has the history of the people of Singapore. I learnt a lot from going to this museum about the mix of people in Singapore and their traditions,"
Tom M,300,Sep 2012,May 2012,50,Very informative insight into this special culture,"A small but very informative museum, packed with colourful exhibits to inform the visitor about most aspects of Peranakan life and culture. An interesting contrast with the attraction of the same name in Penang: this one is about eduacting you, the Penang one more about getting a feel for living in a large wealthy Peranakan house.<br/><br/>Much more interesting overall than the nearby National Museum."
eymwonder,180,Sep 2012,August 2012,40,Good to see,"This little musuem showcases the ""Baba and Nonya"" culture of South-East Asia.  Very well-presented exhibits, and comfortable settings, with detailed descriptions of artifacts."
Jeffrey C,490,Sep 2012,September 2012,40,A unique South East Asian museum,"The Peranankan museum is unique in Singapore of a unique cultural group, a mixture of Malays and Chinese. The culture is rich in its unique jewellery, costume, cuisine and patois. It is a very informative centre and definitely worth a visit."
AlandeWalden,422,Sep 2012,September 2012,50,Well worth a planned visit.,A large museum with intelligently planned displays that have plenty of explanatory detail to help visitors unused to the Peranakan culture understand its origins and traditions. <br/><br/>There is a very small cafe by the entrance - 2 tables! Worth dropping in for the atmosphere.
John P,141,Sep 2012,February 2012,40,Who are the Peranakan?,You can find out here. Some beautiful exhibits and intelligent information passing. It is even a nice building and there are some good sound effects.
L_R_Htravels,181,Sep 2012,NA,40,Lovely museum great for kids as well,I went for free as part of the night festival so can't comment fairly on price but thOught I was a really beautiful museum well laid out and interesting lots if interactive stuff and lots for young kids
suanc,59,Aug 2012,August 2012,40,Singapore cultural attractions,"The Peranakan Museum proved a pleasant surprise with its huge collection of Straits Chinese artifacts ranging from porcelain items to jewellery to clothes won by the peranakan. Very well documented. Well worth a visit.<br/>Chinatown has nicely restored buildings housing restaurants and shops selling reasonably priced items, a lot from China. A good place to get some gifts. The Buddhst Temple with Budhha's tooth was a real find - right in the heart of Chinatown."
genkhis_khan,127,Aug 2012,August 2012,40,Small museum covering with essential Singapore culture,"I would recommend for anyone interested in the ethnic history and traditional culture of Singapore.  It has a claming laid back atmosphere, well-presented high quality exhibits and is housed in an oldf architecturally interesting building. I think it takes about an hour to get the best out of this museum but you could stretch it to a couple of hours if you want to do it very thoroughly.  Tiny True Blue Pantry just by the museum entance is good for a coffee and snack when you've finished.  The museum is within walking distance of places like Raffles City and Chijmes."
haosmom,5,Aug 2012,April 2012,50,Great Museum  Must see,"This is one of the best museums in Singapore.  The collection is beautiful and the museum goes above and beyond to involve visitors (especially children) in the exhibits.  Plan 2 hours or more to see everything.  They frequently have special programs for kids that are 10/10.  If you only do 2 museums in Singapore, this and the National Museum should be the 2!"
Lava_Trek,57,Aug 2012,June 2012,50,Unsual museum that celebrates a culture,"This museum is great for kids.  It has a scavenger hunt all the time.  If you visit during special weekends, there are great extra events for kids - learning to play traditional games, creating special art works, listening to a school group play the anklung, etc."
c0sm0p0litangirl,295,Aug 2012,January 2012,40,I love it!,"it is a more cultural museum than National Museum of Singapore. I really like the way they display the mixed culture, from Christian, Budha, Muslim. And also the cultural things from all over Asia. It is a very serious work that they do their best to satisfy the visitor. And yes, I am very satisfied."
neurosis3000,35,Jul 2012,February 2012,50,Fascinating,"This museum is setup like a traditional Peranakan house with the various appointments and furniture in their original locations. Many examples of crockery, clothing and personal effects.<br/><br/>A nice touch were telephones which played recordings of typical conversation between Peranakans."
Suefazack,29,Jul 2012,June 2012,50,Excellent museum,This is a lovely museum. It is set in a beautiful building (which I think was an old school). I visited when there was a display of the Kabaya a traditional style of dress. When I arrived a tour was about to start so I joined it. I learnt so much about Peranakan life. The displays were done so beautiful and the tour guide was excellent in her delivery.
joanne a,1,Jul 2012,NA,20,Boring. Just okay.,"My husband and i visited this museum before heading towards the Singapore Natl Museum. We regret dropping here first. The artifacts were nice but the museum's layout was really weird. Plus they kept on stating and remarking a certain Emily. For a non-singaporean like me, we couldnt really relate. Anyhow i guess that's how much a SGD 6 is worth. If your stay in singapore is short, no need to visit this place."
analisa p,7,Jul 2012,NA,40,"Peranakan Museum it reminds me of my ancestor house in the philippines,the concrete curving design","Museum is about displaying our heritage, ilove the tradition they put and display,the art, ect..."
OnsenCheeseII,15,Jul 2012,July 2012,50,Nice Place,The reception staff was cheerful and helpful. The decoration of the museum was beautiful. You will have cheaper tickets with your family. You will gain a small gift after collecting all the stamps from the “family treasures stations” located in different areas. It is near to the Singapore Philatelic Museum which is worth going as well.
kaatje57,87,Jul 2012,September 2011,40,A small gem,A very well presented museum. Not to big so you can do the whole place in one go without getting exhausted. The museum looks nice inside and out. Gives you a clearer picture of the old Singapore and it's people.
RunningMan0,"1,281",Jul 2012,July 2012,40,Rich Exploration Of A Unique Singaporean Culture,"The Peranakan Museum is a journey into the Peranakan culture, its history and traditions. Boasting one of the world's largest collection of Peranakan artifacts, in 10 different galleries, the Peranakan Museum is a unique experience. <br/><br/>In Gallery 1: Origins of the Peranakan Museum, visitors can explore the timeline of the Peranakans, as well as see examples of Singaporean Peranakans. Try and spot some well known faces! <br/><br/>In Galleries 2, 3, 4, and 5: Wedding of the Peranakan Museum, visitors can browse a huge collection of wedding artifacts and view exhibits of cultural practises. The famous Peranakan skill in beadwork is also showcased here. <br/><br/>On the uppermost level of the Peranakan Museum, Gallery 6: Nonya showcases the Nonyas, and their beadwork, embroidery and textile arts. Gallery 7: Religion explores the evolution of beliefs in Peranakan culture, while Gallery 8: Public Life showcases prominent Singaporean Peranakans. Gallery 9: Food And Feasting showcases the Peranakan dining customs, and their intricate porcelain work. It also includes a exhibit kitchen and dining hall. Gallery 10: Conversations explores the future for modern Peranakans. <br/><br/>The Dr. Tan Tsze Chor Gallery and the Upper Annex Gallery of the Peranakan Museum houses special temporary exhibitions. During my visit, the special exhibition was Emily Of Emerald Hill: Singaporean Identity On Stage. Written by playwright Stella Kon based on her personal experience, Emily Of Emerald Hill is a one-woman play about Peranakan lifestyle, that has won awards worldwide. This exhibition traces the history, development, and accolades of the play, and its author. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, during my visit most of the interactive multi-media stations were under maintenence. Still, there was a lot of things and exhibits to see. However, the Peranakan Museum isn't very interactive in nature, so kids may get bored. <br/><br/>If you're planning a visit, do note that admission fees cost $6 per person, and allocate around 1 to 2 hours for viewing."
esmodes,184,Jul 2012,July 2012,50,One of the early culture fusion,"I am fascinated by Peranakan Cuisine, Culture and Fashion - one of the earlier mashups and fusions in Asia and The Singapore Peranakan Museum doesn't dissappoint. It's a refreshing spot, a charming Peranakan style building in the middle of the modern metal and glass structures in downtown Singapore. The exhibits were well curated and one goes through a film that shows the interesting mix of cultures and the different types of Peranakan. Then one goes through different exhibits showing the Cuisine, Fashion and Furniture. They even had a whole floor focused on EMILY of EMERALD Hills a One-Woman Play about a Peranakan Lady. Unfortunately we weren't able to watch the play (you can catch it during the weekends). What a nice way to spend a half-day in Singapore...don't miss this museum!"
MorskaVydra,164,Jul 2012,July 2012,40,Revelation Related to Asia Civilization,"Peranakans are people of mixed crossracial heritage with interesting hybrid culture that evolved over years of intermarriage between immigrant men from China, India and Indonesia and local Malay women since the 17th century in the former British Straits Settlements of Singapore, Malacca and Penang. Of the 10 permanent galleries I've enjoyed most probably the first on the origins of the Peranakans with the collection of great contemporary and historical photoes. And the Wedding Gallery - have you ever heard about a wedding taking 12 days? Entrance fee is only S$6 and it is great experience for a rainy morning."
Mel,37,Jul 2012,June 2012,50,Really explains the people,An essential for any visitor who is interested in the diversity of Singapore.
ECAMERONSanFrancisco,135,Jul 2012,December 2011,40,Intriging culture,"This is a lovely museum that describes the mixed culture that resulted from the blending of Chinese and Malay. The museum tells the story of marriage, birth rites and of every day life through coustoms, artifacts and period rooms. There is exqusite intricate jewelry , embriidered wraps and carved furniture that is ""over the top"" in design by comparasion to traditional Chinese design.The gift shop is a draw but the biggest draw is the excellent restaurant next door. Here you can experience the true peranakan taste treats in a very authentic shop house environment. This is not to be missed and it is open for dinner even when the museum is closed. A taxi stand is right in front of the museum so jump in one of those economical Singapore cabs and go!"
lixT,180,Jul 2012,July 2012,40,Decent display,"$6 for adult and $3 for senior citizen.<br/><br/>Not a massive collection but a decent collection of peranakan culture from the birth, life, wedding and death .  Visited together with a friend who is of peranakan descent so it brought back memories of the good old days."
msLooLoo,11,Jul 2012,June 2012,50,Nice to visit - especially if you are Peranakan ;),"Spent few hours on a Saturday there, and since it was an unplanned visit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed on how detailed and well maintained this museum was. <br/><br/>As a Peranakan, I was presented by a thoroughly well explanation of my ancestor history (sort of!). The exhibits are all well presented, informative, and well-taken care of. It was like I was taken back to the time of my grandparents, there are the clothing that they wore, the housewares that they used, etc. It was an amazing experience!<br/><br/>Do check my blog page for photos:<br/>http://dayswithlooloo.blogspot.com/2012/07/singapore-peranakan-museum.html"
Seabird21,620,Jul 2012,June 2012,50,good way to cool down for 2 hours,"This is a beautifully maintained museum with lots of displays emphasising the people behind the culture. I learned a lot and had fun walking around and participating in the displays. There's one section where you pick up different phones to hear people chatting with different accents and dialects and it was a fascinating insight into what went on years ago. <br/><br/>Wonderfully airconditioned, which is always important with the otherwise overwhelming humidity in Singapore. Clean bathrooms too."
Rene K,356,Jun 2012,June 2012,40,Heritage in Katong,"This little old house give you a good insight of the Peranakan life style, it is realyy interesting what is packed in this house, if you are interested in the ""roots"" of SG, go here. Lot's of good little restaurants as well here."
Pankun74,16,Jun 2012,June 2012,40,Peranakan Museum,"The Peranakan Museum is a well curated exhibition of the origin and identities associated with the Peranakan culture. As a descendant of Peranakan, I was very interested in understanding my own heritage. I found most aspects of the museum informative. Disappointments were the stuttering DVD in the 'Emily of Emerald Hill' exhibition space and the 'light and sound' show of a typical life in a Peranakan kitchen (this is hi-tech Singapore, isn't it?!) The Museum store left us wanting; no Emily of Emerald Hill DVD or script, few historical texts and a small selection of cookbooks. My father's book collection is more extensive on the Nonya culture!<br/>Hot tip: Get the combined ticket that allows you to enter the 'Asian Civilisations Museum' for small extra fee. It's well worth it! Enjoy!"
NLBS,53,Jun 2012,June 2012,50,Beautifully done introduction to Peranakan life and culture,"The building itself is lovely and the exhibits are really well done. The first floor explains who Peranakans are and their history.  The rest of the museum introduces you to Peranakan life and culture, especially marriage and weddings (which are 12 days of ceremony and celebration),  We took a tour with a guide who herself was Peranakan and brought everything to life for us through her personal experiences.  The tour was to be an hour, but after 90 minutes we reluctantly bid her goodbye and continued on our own to the third level.  We will return in the hopes of another docent who is as knowledgeable and proud of her heritage."
wasseryharp,33,Jun 2012,June 2012,40,Nice place!,"A bit small and i think it has many info on marriage while few on other topic.<br/>But great place to visit anyway, especially if you're interested in Chinese or Asian culture."
limericklin,124,Jun 2012,June 2012,40,Informative exhibition on Peranakans,"Located in an old primary school, Tao Nan School, the construction of this building was completed in 1912. <br/><br/>On the first floor, there is only one gallery, which talks about what it means to be Peranakan- the definition of Peranakan and what it means to be one. You can see the faces of many Peranakans and what kind of Peranakans they are (e.g. Peranakan Chinese, Jawi Peranakan, Chitty Melaka etc.)<br/><br/>On the second floor, Galleries 2-5 are about the traditions for Pernakan weddings. You get to see the rituals and the things that the bride and bridegroom's families have to give each other to prepare for the wedding. There is also the Museum's famous collection of beadwork.<br/><br/>On the third floor, the galleries were about being a Nonya, religion, public life, food and feasting and conversations. I was sorely disappointed to realise that there weren't any models of food in the Food and Feasting gallery. For the Religion Gallery, there is a warning on the pamphlet: ""Please note that young children and sensitive persons may be disturbed by the display on death and mourning"".<br/><br/>I really liked the idea of the stamp ever since I saw it for the first time at the Terracotta Exhibition at ACM. These stamps are scattered around the museum. Kids will be enthralled by the different motifs, such as dragon, phoenix, ang ku kueh etc. <br/><br/>Admission is free for visitors age 6 and below, all Singaporean + PR residents aged 60 and above, all Singaporean and Singapore PR students, teachers and full-time NSMen. Please refer to the website for all other rates."
cavsfan007,71,Jun 2012,May 2012,50,Great Experience.,"A must do for first time visitors to Singapore.  Very relaxing, not scary at all even for those who have a fear of heights.  Try and book the flight in the evening around sunset for a more spectacular view."
bellabruni,67,Jun 2012,June 2012,40,Great way to spend an hour,A great spot to hit if you're interested in learning about Peranakan food/culture. Well curated and worth the price of admission. Something very local and can be done in about an hour. Definitely good for residents or visitors.
DoctrineofGabe,37,Jun 2012,September 2011,40,Interesting museum,"This is one museum my mother and I enjoyed. In a converted house, the way in which it is placed out ensures you enjoy everything about this place. <br/>I wish now that I was Peranakan :-)"
Edna1234,39,Jun 2012,May 2012,50,Worth a visit,Very interesting and gives a good insight into the early settlement of Singapore
runawaymind,60,Jun 2012,NA,50,Fascinating history that came alive,"Came here with my husband, mother and sister. My mother is of Peranakan background so we know quite a bit about Peranakan culture but we learnt so many new interesting facts and details from our enthusiastic and informative guide Lesley. I'd suggest you go in time for a guided tour (11am on the day we were there - Sat). We had a good chuckle over the wedding customs. My husband who is of South African background found it eye-opening."
Peridot28,30,May 2012,May 2012,20,Tiny place,Very small museum with a very small collection on exhibition
Denise095,302,May 2012,May 2012,40,Well worth a visit,This is in an interesting old building built by the same architect who designed the old Raffles hotel and was once a school.  It is a relatively new and not widely known museum and gives a lot of information in a very interesting way about a group of people who have a history of contributing to the development of South East Asia.  Stylishly done. In a great area too
ayushmanc,135,May 2012,May 2012,30,Very Average,"The museum was nothing great , quite boring actually, i was out in 10 mins. I advise you save the S$6 entrance and check out the National Museum at S$10."
laansa,79,May 2012,April 2012,20,Not the most exciting museum in Singapore,A beautiful building and some colourful artefacts but not super interesting. Recommend combining a visit with a walk around Fort Canning Park. Otherwise it is a bit of a waste of time.
BangkokJock,313,May 2012,May 2012,40,Worth visiting,"Its abit out of the way, but worth a visit to understand Singaporean Chinese &amp; Indian peranakan culture.  Good exhibits &amp; displays for wedding customs, costumes, eating, food, household, etc.  Staff is very helpful &amp; friendly.  <br/>I still like the Peranakan Mansion in Penang more because its more authentic in an old mansion, but this one is very well done too."
Linda M,223,May 2012,November 2011,50,Good use for a historical building,"The Peranakan Museum is in a 1912 building first used as a school.  A nice setting to allow visitors to learn and appreciate the history and culture of the various Peranakan peoples living in Southeast Asia. These are descendants of local Southeast Asian and non-locals, including Chinese and Indian settlers. <br/><br/>The exhibits are well-displayed, with multi-media descriptions. Worth visiting!"
Merrymay,4,May 2012,May 2012,50,Surprisingly special,"Loved it. As a local, I had thought I knew something about the Peranakan culture. What an eye opener. Go. Look out for the designer pieces. There were famed designers from way back when for the beautiful intricate lace tops and the sarongs."
Kat0425,540,May 2012,March 2012,40,"Nice museum, not many tourists","This is an interesting museum, worth seeing if you are in the vicinity. It does not seem as popular as some of the other museums, but the lack of a crowd is nice."
NinaAsia,435,May 2012,September 2011,50,Interesting insight into Singapore's unique Peranakan culture,"The rich heritage of the Peranakan culture is a must-see for everyone(including educational activities for children) keen on local customs, cuisine, fashion &amp; history. We visit the museum at least once a year as there are excellent theme-based exhibits that showcase the skills and talents of the Peranakans."
Andrew D,7,May 2012,April 2012,50,Great for whole family,Very interactive and interactive with a unique insight into Singaporean history and culture
CDMLMM,114,Apr 2012,April 2012,40,Fine insight into Peranakan community,Small but very well presented museum with a range of artefacts from life among the Peranakan community over last 200 years. Well worth a visit if interested in social history and art.
Xen_Paul,387,Apr 2012,April 2012,40,Very Interesting and well thought out,This is a little gem of a museum and if you link it with a trip to the BaBa House rounds off an informative insight into the Peranakan culture of Singapore.
Luvshiraz,162,Apr 2012,March 2012,50,Peranakan Treasures,"Enjoyed a personal guided tour by one of the ""Friends Of Museum"" trained docents - knowledgeable of the artifacts featured in this tiny treasure of a museum just off the beaten path.  The Kebaya display, the ceramics and the traditions are well worth seeing; there's much to be learned of the history of the settlement of Singapore!"
DebMcD,54,Apr 2012,April 2012,40,Very well laid out,Really interesting and well thought out but sadly many of the displays weren't working.
1sma2,29,Apr 2012,March 2012,30,Interesting but,"we expected to learn more about the cross-cultural challenges of mixed group marriages/families and the almost total focus on Chinese culture, left us wondering why?  Still it was interesting to have a museum with the goal of showing the nature of this mixed culture."
Lucy H,13,Apr 2012,April 2012,40,An interesting glance at a section of Singapore,"A beautiful crafted and laidout museum combining the new with the old traditions. The colours and displays were immaculate, plus the interactive part of collecting different symbols stamps in some of the gallery sections. I knew nothing about the peranakans or what it meant to be one bwofre going, but was well informed and interested to learn more on leaving."
Kansas-Jayhawk,35,Apr 2012,April 2012,40,Great little museum,"This is a very interesting little museum which tells about the Peranakan culture. I had no idea what ""Peranakan"" meant, so I decided to visit. I was glad I did. Exhibits in the museum explained who the Peranakans were (are) and their lifes. The exhibit on weddings was most interesting - 12 days for a wedding!! Amazing. I would definitely recommend this museum. It's not too big and it is very interesting.After visiting the museum, go see some of the remaining Peranakan houses on Emerald Hill off Orchard Road."
MrGoh,697,Apr 2012,NA,50,"Wonderful Outing - if you only have time for one Musuem, visit this one!","The exhibits and multi media shows are wonderful. Make sure you pick up the free collage from the counter on ground floor so you can collect the seal stamping and you go around the exhibits. <br/><br/>Rich heritage, interesting and informative."
Walpy,256,Mar 2012,March 2012,50,Really interesting way to spend an hour or two,There's so little history left in Singapore that this is a pleasant contrast to the cement and glass.  It tells the story of the upper class Chinese Straits community around the turn of the 19c and is a nice complement to similar museums in Malacca and Penang.  Take a quick look in the Armenian church while you're in the neighborhood too.
carolinesharp,105,Mar 2012,March 2012,40,Very interesting,"Beautiful building, interesting museum, helpful staff, well arranged exhibition, child friendly with activities for children.  A small museum but a must see for any one who wants to dig a bit into singapore heritage and culture."
Irene H,91,Mar 2012,March 2012,50,An educational experience - the unique culture of the Peranakans,"Great place to visit to learn about this unique blended culture of Chinese and Malay through language, food, clothing, jewellery, arts and crafts and customs.<br/><br/>The museum has a wide and rich array of artifacts depicting the Peranakan way of life through showcasing a layout of the kitchen, dining room, sitting area, bedroom, altar for ancestral worship, a wedding ceremony and a wake. <br/><br/>A visit to the gift shop is a must for souvenirs."
PurpleLily11,185,Mar 2012,NA,50,A little gem,This museum was a jewel. I don't think it would have occurred to me to even go except it was a work-related recommendation. I'm so glad I went because it was just to cute and rich. I loved it.
chongbrood,176,Mar 2012,February 2012,50,Great insights into a little-known culture,"Three floors of interesting exhibits - all with good signage and information boards - give insight into the little-known Peranakan culture. Get a tour from their knowledgeable guides and docents - some of whom are Peranakan themselves and you'll come away with facts as well as nice anecdotes about the Peranakans. Highly recommended, especially with a tour."
jorden,11,Mar 2012,March 2012,40,go on your own,"we went here as part of a tour and though we enjoyed the rest of the day this was to be the highlight, but we only got 45mins there and the audio talk is 1 hour. It is easy to get to with the MRT and a bus"
Danjiro,230,Mar 2012,NA,50,One of the Best Museums in Singapore,"This museum is well designed, and provides a great glimpse into the lives of the Peranakan (from the Malay term 'locally born') people, their colorful culture, clothing, pottery and festivals they celebrated.  It is in a beautifully restored building and has a great gift shop that is a great place to pick up gifts from Singapore."
Matthias W,9,Mar 2012,March 2012,50,Small memorial to a dying culture,"The Peranakan are people of mixed Chinese-Malay heritage. This museum shows their elaborate culture, making it quite clear why it is going the way of the dodo: Nobody has 12-day wedding ceremonies anymore, and girls do not prepare for life by remaining uneducated and focusing instead on preparing highly ornate feasts and elaborate beadwork to show their patience and gentleness to the matchmakers. The museum, however, will show you the real effects of such a culture and life style, and the results are truly impressive. This is one place where you won't say that times were simpler back then! Don't forget a visit to the gift store for a small selection of stunning sarong kebayas."
Jordan S,134,Mar 2012,January 2012,40,Well put together and informative,"The Peranakan Museum is a must if you want to understand the history and culture of one of the most influential people groups in Singapore. The exhibits are well put together and keep your attention with a combination of reading, artifacts, and hands on activities. Good to spend a few hours here if you have some extended time in Singapore and want to understand the local culture better."
fedrickMendos,22,Mar 2012,March 2012,50,Geat Way to Indigenous Singaporean History &amp; Culture,A lot to learn about indigenous Singapore culture and history - the Peranakan story. There is a nice Authentic Singaporean Food Restaurant few steps away from the museum.

This museum is basically about the history of immigrants in Singapore, that how Indians, Chinese and Malays came to Singapore for trade and ended up living here and how the culture evolved with the three very different cultures murged into one small country. They do give small stamping papers on which you have to stamp in different areas of the Museum so that you don't miss anything."
sensesawaken,179,Feb 2012,NA,50,Fantastic Musuem,"If you want to discover a new culture, I think the Perankan Musuem is the best in the world, it help one the understand the Peranakan culture and appreciate it so much more. Great displays and its really worth the visit"
Xian09,13,Feb 2012,February 2012,50,"""Learned a Lot""",This was our 4th trip to Singapore and finally had time to do this museum.  It was wonderful and I hope to go again.  The museum tells so much of the history of the people who live in Singapore and I wish I had done it on my first trip.  I had no idea it would be as meaningful as it was.
Gethere,67,Feb 2012,January 2012,40,A different Museum experience,"We found this museum very interesting, but it could be because there is Peranakan blood in my family and we went there to find out more about this unique and interesting culture. There is also the option of a guided tour but we chose to browse the museum at our own pace. <br/>The Museum is housed in a colonial style building which is very open and bright. As you move up each level, you move from an introduction to who the Peranakans are, the clothes (intricate and beautiful) they wore, weddings, food, every day life and beliefs. The children were given an activity sheet which helped them navigate the exhibits. The activities involved embosing the sheet they had with various images significant to the Paranakans. <br/>If you're after an insight into the Paranakan culture, this Museum does a good job."
NatTraveler12,115,Feb 2012,January 2012,50,Good insight on a little-known culture,"Fascinating look into the lives of the Straits Chinese, who played such a large role in Singapore's growth as a trading port.  Great combination of displays and interactive activities to keep you engaged.  Lots of fun to ""play dress-up"" and have your photo taken in Peranakan costume!"
GeorgeJorgimoto,"1,356",Feb 2012,NA,30,it's a museum,telling the history of background of the Peranakan culture. One will get all the info about this unique race and its mixed and colorful culture here. You can only find this in South East Asia and nowhere else.

ChapLondon2,147,Feb 2012,February 2012,50,"fabulous introduction to the melting pot of Malay, Chinese and Indian culture","well-displayed Exhibits related to the cross culture peoples of this region.  ESSENTIAL you go on the docent-led tour AND the guided tour of the current exhibition of Clothing history,  Even if you are not interested in fabrics and textiles, you will learn so much about this regions's melting-pot history from being guided through the exhibit,  I have travelled Asia for decades and still learned so much from this little museum"
KeepMemories,462,Jan 2012,January 2012,50,The unique Singapore experience,"Perhaps you cannot find another place with such dedication to the Paranakan culture which is unique to the early chinese settlers who created the hybrid culture with the original locals.<br/>You can read more about this culture, museum and the other interesting buildings within the vincinity in my blog:<br/>http://1place1dream.blogspot.com/search/label/-%20Singapore?updated-max=2012-01-19T07:25:00-08:00&amp;max-results=20"

ACulinaryJourney,11,Jan 2012,December 2011,50,The Babas in a nutshell,"A pretty quaint little museum, with an excellent display of exhibits. Especially loved the ones that mimic how certain rooms in a baba's house is renovated.<br/>===================<br/>http://AppetiteTeasers.blogspot.com"
Eloise H,6,Jan 2012,December 2011,50,Beautiful and Interesting,"The Peranakan Museum features the art and culture of the Peranakan peoples of Singapore.  The exhibit centers around the 12 day wedding celebration with beautiful jewery, textiles and ceramics.  My friend calls this the ""Batik"" museum."
Kumar P,72,Jan 2012,January 2012,50,Excellent-,"well organised and put together, great costumes good commentary and all in all a lovely worthwhile, educational and enjoyable experience"

barbaraanne6,46,Jan 2012,February 2011,50,A good way to see the old Singapore,"A good place to visit and it is for everyone, I cannot go up many stairs so was glad of the lifts to all floors.   You felt as if you were at the Weddings and dinners.   All was good even the gift shop even though it was expensive I found a cheap fan so I was happy"
babyp878,2,Jan 2012,January 2012,50,Place to Know the Authentic Singaporean Culture &amp; Heritage,Kabaya (?) designs were qnique &amp; colourful and the style is same as Singapore Air Hostess attire.
robfbme,11,Jan 2012,NA,40,Embossers delight.,"If you want to go to a museum for less than an hour and have kids or travel with someone who likes to touch things at museums, this is a good match.  It does have many flights of stairs.  Not sure about elevator, but every room has interesting cultural items on display and an embosser for you to stamp on your program of a symbol of a dragon, butterfly, peacock, etc...   There was a cut throat race for acquiring these embossed stamps by a dynamic fourth grade class the day we were there.  It made the museum seem very lively and less sterile than we were expecting."
Carol Blue Mountains,274,Dec 2011,December 2011,40,One for the ladies,"Small museum near the SAM and National museum.  Interesting subject matter and lots of fabrics, wedding regalia and a great sarong display when I was there.  Not a lot for the gentlemen though"
Teirrah,88,Dec 2011,December 2011,40,Very interesting for both adults and children,I have been very impressed with Singapore museums.  I visited during the time of a Nyona clothing exhibition which was fascinating and information was given in an easy to digest (my attention span is slipping as the years add up) form.  Fun activities for children too would (I think) keep them engaged.  I would go back.
commscholar,133,Dec 2011,December 2011,40,"Small museum, wonderful info","I had a great time here.  Its a quick museum (1-2 hours), but tells me a lot about an aspect of Singapore I didn't know much about."
sralls,418,Dec 2011,NA,40,Lovely old world charm,Nice collonial building but the areas that the public access is the public shops rather than the hotel proper.
PHI,111,Dec 2011,December 2011,40,Great education about the local culture,This is a great museum if you want to learn about the different ethniticies in Singapore.
skink,368,Dec 2011,September 2011,50,A great little museum with a window on this unique culture,"The Peranakan Museum is very manageable and has a wonderful collection of clothing, kitchen items, and furniture from this fascinating culture that is a blend of Chinese and Malay.  The displays are excellent and after an hour os so you have a great introduction to this culture that is unique to Singapore and Melaka in Malaysia."
Friedrich880,2,Dec 2011,December 2011,20,not my favourite,"simply too much on peranakan culture and much too much clothing. Unless you bought a joint-ticket for both this and the asian civilization museum, I wouldn' t recommend a visit.<br/>Although the clothing is certainly beautiful!"
lisasplaces,"8,502",Dec 2011,December 2011,50,A great insight into Peranakan life in a beautiful building,"This museum is worthy of an hour or so of your time while in Singapore. There is also a free guided tour at 2pm. You learn all about life as a Peranakan and how the Perenakans came to be in Singapore. This museum is probably more interesting to ladies, as it does concentrate on the ""nona"" of the house. But some beautiful pieces in here and equisite beadwork. There is also a sampang exhibition on at the moment - good for anyoe with an interest in clothes"

SY T,7,Dec 2011,January 2011,50,Fantastic,"Great display of the rich Peranakan culture which I find very similar to what I understand of our local SEA Chinese culture, it makes me more appreciative of the diversity and tradition that we have and should preserve. If you are a tourist, it's a must visit!"
tabimin,26,Dec 2011,February 2011,40,tasteful,although i preferred the peranakan museums in malaysia<br/>i'd still recommend this lovely small but informative museum<br/>especially if you can get the asian civilizations museum &amp; peranakan museum joint-ticket
JandJAdelaide,214,Nov 2011,November 2011,50,Really interesting,This is well worth a visit if you have any interest in the history of Singapore and the Straits generally.  Currently they have a really interesting special exhibition about batiks and sarongs.  The whole thing was quite fascinating.
GSar,138,Nov 2011,September 2011,50,Very educational,"I have been impressed by this museum. Location, building itself and the collection are quite educational. Perhaps one of the best places to understand the peranakan culture, what it is all about."
Skakagrall,157,Nov 2011,November 2011,50,Celebrating Peranakan style,"Fascinating museum about the special inter-racial style of the Peranakan communities of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore"
melscottmax,304,Nov 2011,November 2011,40,pleasant way to spend an hour or so,"This small museum is close to other attractions and a visit could be combined with a walk around Fort Canning (as I did), or a visit to the nearby Philatetic Museum, or the National Museum. (The National Museum requires quite a bit of time to do it ""justice"" though).<br/><br/>There were 3 floors with 9 galleries showcasing traditional life styles, dress and practises of Singapore / Melacca Peranakan people. (Mixed heritage people from Chinese and Indian traders intermarrying with local Malay women). The building itself is a renovated colonial style, but the displays are modern with audio-visual interactives. At only $6 entrance fee, I thought it was a pleasant side track from  a walking circuit around the Fort Canning Park."
divezuzu,322,Oct 2011,September 2011,50,Beautiful museum,"I loved this museum because it was about people and how they lived and do live now.  The mix of cultures and how that played out in everyday life was so interesting.  If you love to look at beautiful objects, this is the place.  The interviews presented in film clips on the top floor were great.  I've been to Singapore many times and always wanted to vist this museum but never did until now - don't make my mistake.  It will give you a new perspective of life in Singapore."
nek88,482,Oct 2011,September 2011,40,Peranakan Museum,"If you like the look of the outside of the building that housing the museum, you will love the treasure and stories inside.  A totally captivating look at life of mixed marriages, religions, cultures and nationalities.  The staff were friendly and we took up the offer of the S$10 ticket to visit this museum and the Asian Civilisation Museum."
Gina L,298,Sep 2011,August 2011,40,Beautiful Museum - Well worth a visit on special event day!,"The Peranakan Museum showcases the culture and history of Peranakan communities in Southeast Asia... The galleries are organised into different themes... for example, weddings on level 2 and various (food &amp; feasting, religion, etc) on level 3.... The displays are really beautiful....<br/>I brought my boy on their special event night (which was held as part of the Night Festival 2011), entrance was free from 6pm onwards, and there were various activities for kids.... My boy commented:"" I had great fun at the museum.... Next time, we can go again...""<br/>However, for normal days when nothing much is going on, it can be a tad boring for a young kid..."
Stéphane L,462,Jul 2011,July 2011,50,Excellent museum that gives good insight on the Straights' Chinese civilisation,"Very comprehensive collection on display that gives extensive explanation as to how Perenakan people evolved in the late XVIII, XIX and early XX th centuries. Definitely worth the visit to better understand a flowering period for Malacca, Penang and Singapore that ended with WWII."
Liz R,214,May 2011,May 2011,50,"best museum in Singapore, in fact, a small gem","absolutely beautiful and gracious place, a great way to learn about the culture of Chinese mixed race Singapore. Beautiful display of breathtaking native costumes right now-- you have never seen such exquisite fabrics and lace blouses ever, anywhere, period. Great neighborhood, pricey museum shops, fabulous True Blue restraurant right next door is a don;'t miss experience!!! This is a secret gem in the colonial district of Singapore. Convenient to many other museums and attractions, well worth the modest admission."

Try to walk with the experts who do a tour every now and then. That takes longer but you see everything!<br/><br/>I went with friends and thought it was a good way to discover how the culture in the city has become the way it is!
sebhoff,878,Mar 2011,March 2011,30,Quite nice - but there are better places,"This is quite well done - different galleries on three floors, each with their own topic (e.g. weddings). I'm a bit biased, though, because I've been to the Baba-Nonya Heritage Museum in Malacca, which I found absolutely stunning. Here, the exhibits are placed in relatively bare and sterile rooms - in Malacca, the house itself is part of the attraction. But it's still definitely worth going!"

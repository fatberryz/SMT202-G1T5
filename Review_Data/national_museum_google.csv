Very helpful guidance at the Reception. I was advised on better price options and best time management for the visit. There were two exhibitions going on at the time. I could buy a combined ticket that saved me some money. Great. Thank you.",2020-01-02 17:12:03

Huge museum of Singapore historical collections. As you expected from a museum. Clean and nicely decorated, nice building too. Good for those who loves and curious about Singapore history. Good for all kind of visitors, with family, couple, friends or alone. But you might expect walking a bit because of the vast building.",2020-02-29 09:04:13

The museum itself is modern and well set up. They have a variety of exhibition halls. They tell the story nicely and also make use of interactive tools to engage the audience more. Overall, I recommend it! Students also get a discount if you show your student card :)",2019-12-15 17:10:10

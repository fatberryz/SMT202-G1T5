This building was once the Singapore seat of rule and law and its historic past can be imagined on the lawns at the front. If you like a gallery...you'll love a visit here. I spent a day wandering through both buildings and had a very restful time soaking up the art. Take a break with tea and tea and finish off with a cocktails in the upper bar and breathe in the view before you.,2019-12-08 05:41:46

It explains more about the history of Singapore but in an interactive way. All the digital experience is amazing! I loved the cinema! 

The building is nice and their staff is friendly. 

If visiting Singapore is definitely worth to visit.",2019-08-07 19:57:47

I still remember a small exhibition on such a mundane thing as Hainanese Chicken Rice: it gave an incredibly interesting reflection on the cultural and ethnic mix of Singapore.,2020-01-05 16:11:01

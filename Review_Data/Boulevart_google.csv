It was fun, the group was slightly too big but I guess it was ok for the price you’re paying. Much cheaper than most painting places!",2020-01-13 07:22:37

You really have to very explicitly ask for it. It was in fact quite frustrating and so didn't think it was worth the money. The space is also very tiny and you just sit at a table with everyone - not an inspiring art workshop you may have hoped for. For the price, quite disappointing and so would not recommend.",2019-09-14 11:45:55

It was the first time I attended an adult guided art session ever and I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Boulevart! Instructor Valerie was incredibly patient and helpful that even novice like me could end up with something so beautiful (I'm honestly in love with my art piece haha!) Highly recommend Boulevart to others who are considering taking up painting classes or simply wanted one-off session to enjoy some art jamming with friends. We sure will be back too!",2018-09-22 11:55:04

The guide (teacher) was very helpful and you could retain your own ideas with modifications of the workshop paintings. Affordable price for the materials provided. Great for kids' and adults alike,2017-12-04 04:13:05

The best museum experience I ever had. The collections are varied from many types of genre. The place is enormous with two wings, City Hall and the Supreme Court. In City Hall wing, which is the largest one, you can see lots of exhibitions and gallery, both permanent and not. In the Supreme Court, all exhibits are placed inside all courthouse so you can experience the real courthouse. Most of the collections are historical, including the Independence Declaration.
For Singaporean residence, it is free of charge, but for a foreigner, we need to pay some money. You can also be their member for more privileges. If you come as students or teacher, don't forget to bring your identification card so you can have a discounted price. See their website for more information. 
My advice for visiting this place, spend three hours minimum if you want to see all parts of the exhibitions. The area is also quiet and relaxing.",2019-12-27 03:43:36

Staff was very polite and helpful, even if there were some old staff trying their best to show the guests where to go and what to see. The building itself was a work of art with the unique design inside and other decorations. I really like the paintings. I didn't even need to go to the museum to learn about the history of Singapore, it was right there, inside each paintings which carried with them different cultures and traditions from different ethnic in Singapore. The color using was marvelous. The same material can create matted color or shinny oil color. The photographer's zone was very interesting, too. It show old life of Singapore before it was so great like that. It was history inside every piece of art.",2020-02-20 18:17:42

It got 6 floors and all floors contained great exhibition. You can spend hours inside just to admire all artworks as well as the building itself. Restaurant, giftshop, and restroom also provided inside makes this gallery even more convenience. For travellers who seek for tap water, they also have it inside, near the restroom. Good facilities for all art lovers.",2020-01-29 10:59:08

Great place to spend some time and absorb some culture. Took a free tour and loved the docent who was both entertaining and informative. Singapore has many places worthy of your time. But, this ranks high on that list.",2019-12-30 22:25:47

Spent about 2 hours there (only had that amount of time to spare), and I think I will need to return for a whole day at some point, in order to be able to fully appreciate the exhibits.",2019-12-28 11:45:40
